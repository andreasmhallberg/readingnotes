  > there is no linguistic category, from single phenomenin, to complete utterence, for which al-Ḫlīl did non provide Sībawayhi either with datar or theory or often both

## Manuscript

- Two manuscript traditions: Eastern and Andalusian. 38

- Arrangement 38
  - (sort of) introduction with first 7 chapters (*risāla*)
  - syntax
  - morphology
  - phonology

## Data sources

- poetry. 1056 verses. 43
  - Only from three contemporary poets
  - did not attribute verses to authors
  - Quran. 421 verses.

  - Made up material.
    - Dominant form of examples.
    - Illustrate abstract rules.

## Terminology 

- Proposed sequence of development. 49-50
  1. Terms concerned with correct pronunciation and Quranic preservation: cases, vowels 
  2. Interest in textual content (pre-Sibawayhian *naḥwiyūn*): *qiyās*
  3. S. and later tradition
- Influence from law
- Extensive use of metaphors of family (*umm, axawāt*) and health (*ʿilla*)
- Words used in both technical and pre-technical sense (*ḥarf, iḍāfa, ḥāl*) 53

## Principles

- Focus on natural speech, a social activity bound by context. 56
- Pragmatics
  - discusses filled pauses and self corrections
  - Speaker intent and listeners interpretation taken into account to understand grammatical construction's
- Evaluation of sentences: 61
  - semantics
    - *mustaqīm*: semantically well formed
    - *ġrayr mustaqīm*: does not convey intended meaning
    - *muḥāl*: self-contradictory
  - grammar
    - *hasan*: structurally well formed
    - *qabīḥ*: structurally ill formed
    - Gradable. A sentence can be more or less structurally good (*aḥsan*), often depending on context.
    - several synonyms: *jamīl, jayyid, ḍaʿīf*

## Syntax

- Word classes 75

- Long list of speech acts (*mawḍiʿ*)
  - Language is in essence seen as action with intent

- Operation (*ʿamal*) 87
  - each operator associated with speech act
  - *ḥarf* has only syntacts meaning. Named after the speech act in which it is used (*ḥarf istifhām, nidāʾ, etc.*) 88

- Grammatical phenomenon disussed in many different parts from different perspectives. 69

## Morphology

## Phonology

- 29 consonantal phonemes listed. 125
  - + 5 found in Quranic recitation
  - + 7 deemed as incorrect

- 16 points of articulation, beginning from back of throat.

- Manner of articualtion 126
  - Voiced/unvoiced (*majhūra/mahmūsa*).
    - [q] and [ṭ] are voiced, possible representing articulation at the time 
  - Plosive/fricative (*šadīda/rixwa*)
    - [ḍ] as fricative
  - Nasal (*ġunna*) [m], [n]
  - Trilled (*mukarrar*) [r]
  - Velaraised (*muṭbaqa*) emphatic
  - Semi-vowels (*ḥarf layyin/madd*) [w] [y] [ā]

- Assimiliation. 128
  - Partial or complete
  - Caused by similarity in manner or point of articulation

- Other phonological phenomenon
  - *rawn*: inflectional vowel disappears or is only implied
  - *išmām*: vowel quality affected by consonant
  - *imāla*: fronting of [ā]
  - *naṣ*: antonym of *imāla*. Non-fronted [ā]
  - *tafxīm*: backing if [ā] after emphatic consonant

- Only marginal development of phonology after Sibawayhi. 131


## Legacy

- Terminological developments. 139

## Conclusion

- Difficult: 143

> Cirtainly the *Kitāb* is an extraordinarily book to understand.
