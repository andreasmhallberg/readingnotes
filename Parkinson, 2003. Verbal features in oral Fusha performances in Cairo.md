- Trends in diglossia research in Arabic
  1. multiple levels
  2. code-switching.

- Strongly critical of ESA. No one has found grammatical rules. "ESA may not actually be anything". 29

- Sympathetic to code-switching paradigm since speakers often have intuitions of what elements are standard and which are dialect. 29


- 16 participants (two age groups, sex, four education groups, 2x2x4). 30

- Tests: interview and lecture.

- Variables investigated 32-33
  1. imperfect prefix vowel (*ya-/yi-*)
  2. stem vowel in both tenses [?] (*yaktub/yiktib*)
  3. vowel before stem vowel in VII verbs (*yantaxib/yintixib*)
  4. shape of t-prefix in V/Vi (*ta-/it-*)
  5. prefixes *bi-, sa-, ḥa-*
  6. *-na* in imperfect 2fs, 2mp, 3mp (*-īna/-ūna*)


- educational effect 43
  - Crossover effect – HiAr fewer vowels than Hi.

- Some variables show effect of age or sex.

- Effect of situation: all raise vowelling in lecture = aim lower than capable in interview. Table 32. 37

- Conclusions:

  - Diverse forms of speaking for same functional place in the continuum. 38 

  > even a cursory glance at the results above tells us that performances or not all somehow near each other in any statistical sense, even though they would share an identical place in the continuum of defined in a functional sense. If the continuum is defined in terms of features and their variability instead of functionality, these performances are all over the board.

  - Speaker performances varies in complex ways: 39

  > Taking a functional perspective leaves us with overwhelming variability at all levels of the mid section. But taking a more codeswitching-oriented perspective, we can view the resources of colloquial and the resources of MSA as being available to all speakers in this community, and the continuum between them is made up simply of the relative choices each speaker makes as he chooses features from either end, based both on that speaker's amount of control of those resources, and specific intentionalities he may possess for the speech act.

  - Different ways of speaking for same function: 39

  > We are not forced to consider highly diverse types of performances as "like" each other , but we may have to admit that highly diverse performances are used to fill similar functions. 

  - Variables are particles, not waves, and are binarilly H or L. 40

  - Middle defined by ends - speakers learn different forms but are aware of their status as markers of H/L. Ferguson was right.
