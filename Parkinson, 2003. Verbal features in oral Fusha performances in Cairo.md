- Trends in diglossia research in Arabic
  1. multiple levels
  2. code-switching.

- Strongly critical of ESA. No one has found grammatical rules. "ESA may not actually be anything". 29

- Sympathetic to code-switching paradigm since speakers often have intuitions of what elements are standard and which are dialect. 29

- Tests: interview and lecture.

- Speakers use vowels on 30% av verbs, less than 20% of nouns.

- educational effect 43
  - Crossover effect â€“ HiAr fewer vowels than Hi.

- All raise vowelling in lecture = aim lower than capable in interview. Table 32, 37

- Functionally identical, statistically diverse. 38 

  > If the continuum is defined in terms of features and their variability instead of functionality, these performances are all over the board. 39

- Conclusion: middle defined by ends - speakers learn different forms but are aware of their status as markers of H/L. Ferguson was right.
