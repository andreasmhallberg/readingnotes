# Chahine, N., 2012. Reading Arabic: Legibility Studies for the Arabic Script, Leiden: Leiden University.

Eye-tracking testing legibility of simple and complex Arabic letter forms.

- Visual complexity of word formation (letter connection) is not there in early Aragic (Kufi) script. Precursor to simplified letter forms 29

- The hanging characteristic of *nastilƒÅq* is "well suited for Persian, which lacks the vertical accent achieved by the Alif-Lam combination." 35

- Summary of typographic technical development. 35-40

- Linotype created Simplified Arabic with simplified connections for speedy setting. Style now standard in print. 42

- *Nasx* became *de facto* text style during Ottoman period. 43

- Description of principles of dynamic *nasx*. Technically implemented by Milo in Decotype Naskh for Adobe. 48-9

- Tests legibility of simplified, traditional and dynamic Naskh, vowelled and unvowelled. Chap. 7 

- Technical limitations lead to typographic simplification. Now complex type technically available, but simplified forms have been accepted. 181

- Eye-tracking participants: 189-190
    - schools in Beirut
    - no glasses
    - two age groups: 13-14 and 16-17

- Excludes beginning of texts. 193

- Fixations were manually checked.

- Results:
    - Reading time: no effect. 203
    - Fixation time: shorter on simplified (ca. 10ms). [Small effect?] 205
    - Number of fixations: no effect. 206-7
    - Regressions: fewer with vowels. Small effect but larger for younger group. 207-8
    - Distance of forward saccade: shorter with vowels. 211
 
-  Conclusions: 
    - simplified *nasx* is more legible. 206  Non-simplified style means increased fixation time of 4.7%. 221 [Weak support in data. Very small effect.]
    - Vowelling gives fewer regressions but outweighed by visual complexity. 217 [How is this conclusion drawn?]
