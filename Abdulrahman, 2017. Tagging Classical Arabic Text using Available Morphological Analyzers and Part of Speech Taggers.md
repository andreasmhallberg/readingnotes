- POS taggers assign part-of-speech for word. Morphological analyzer is context independent and provides possible morphological interpretations of string. 1

- There is no standard in Arabic POS-tagging.

- Lists POS and morphological analyzers that are: 3 
  - designed for MSA or CA
  - able to analyse all forms of words
  - available freely for research purposes
  - have academic credibility [i.e. published description]

- Seven MAs and eight POS taggers fit the criteria and are described and evaluated.

- Conclusions: 14
  - Most taggers have there own tagset and tokenization scheme.
  - Standardization needed.
  - CA needs it own analyzer or current analyzers need to be expanded to cope with CA.
