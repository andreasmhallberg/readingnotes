English L2 learners of German makes use of arguments' animacy an of word order when parsing German sentences, often ignoring case marking.

- Case is described as a core feature in German and German readers make use of it to parse sentences. 419

- Previous study of English learners of German (Kempe & McWhinney 1989) show that they rely primarily on word order and semantics (animacy) to assign case roles. German L1 readers rely primarily on case marking. 420

- Proposed general pattern that L2 learners tend to process first noun as subject or agent.

- Processing instruction an structured input most efficient L2 teaching method.

- Method: 421
  - English university-level students of German
  - Timed, self-paced sentence comprehension, see sentence and choose between alternative translations. 423
  - Stimuli 2x2: sentences SO/OS, subject animacy +/-.
  - Participants tested three times in one semester.
  - All nouns have unambiguous case marking.

- Results:
  - Better comprehension on OS and animate subject.

- Pedagogical implication: teachers should point out practical value of case. 426
