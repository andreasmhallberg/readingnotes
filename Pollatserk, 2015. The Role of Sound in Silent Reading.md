[Much of this is included in Rayner et al. (2012), *Psychology of Reading.*]

- Discussion on models of word recognition. 186-

- Phonology always a part of lexical identification. Experiments on lexical decisions on heterographic homophones (*meed*/*meat*) "make clear that people don't got directly from print to the orthographic lexicon." 189

- Groups of dyslectics with only *address phonology* or *assembled phonology*. Interpretations of these data for theories of word identification controversial.

- Extraction of phonology begins within 35 ms after fixating word. Shown in parafoveal preview and parafoveal fast priming eye-tracking paradigms. 192

- Phonological encoding crucial far short term memory and therefore reading comprehension. "much of what we think of as short-term memory is a phonological store." 194

- *Subvocalization* (activation of articulately muscles in silent reading) is part of skilled silent reading. 196
  - Aids comprehension at least in difficult prose.
