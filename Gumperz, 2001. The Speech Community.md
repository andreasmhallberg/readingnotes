# Gumperz, John J. 2001. “The Speech Community.” In Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader, edited by Alessandro Duranti and Susan Gal, 66–73. Blackwell Anthologies in Social and Cultural Anthropology 1. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.

- Definition om speech community: 66

    > any human aggregate characterized by regular and frequent interaction by means of a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant differences in language usage.

- Special appliances: 67-68
    - immigrant minority languages, bilinguals
    - secret languages
    - liturgical languages
    - standard languages. Characterized by codification of spelling and grammar and dissemination of codification in education. 68

- *Sprachbund*: two languages which coexist in a social space and have continuous effects on one-another. 68

- Two types of linguistic variatoin: 69-70
    - *Dialectal variation* by group (social, geographical)
    - *superposed variation* "differs types of activities carried on within the same group" 70

- *Language loyalty* "when a literary variety acquires prestige as a symbol of a particular nationality group or social movement." 71
   - may divide linguistically similar languages (Hindi-Urdu, Serbian-Croatian)
   - may unite linguistically diverse languages (Alsace-Lorraine, speak German but loyal to French) [Arabic dialects]

- Medieval Latin and Arabic "extreme examples of supralocal spread".  71

    > Uniformity at the superposed level in their case, however, is achieved at the expense of large gaps in internal communication channels.
