[Good summary of problems with diglossia in education and arabization.]

- Education and literacy:
  - Teaching material today only recognize classical grammar 41 (and its data 40)
  - "The gap between the two varieties can only grow wider" 40 since the grammar cannot be changed.
  - "Standard written Arabic today is still the monopoly of a very small minority of educated Arabs." 40
  - "There does not exist yet any Arabic dictionary or grammar book derived from, or based on, an actual corpus of modern Arabic text." 42
  - "Since the rules of Arabic grammar are based on prescriptive rules instead of actual usage, they will remain hopeless and unattainable for the vast majority of Arabic learners." 42
  - "Mistakes in the use of standard Arabic (i.e. deviations from the prescribed norms) abound on all levels and in various media." 42

- ESA as new standard. It cannot yet be properly described since it is in the making. 43
  - Three trends:
    1. classicization
    2. colloquolization
    3. leveleing. 
    
  - "Taken together, these three processes will undoubtedly result in greater linguistic unification in the Arab countries." 43.

- Regionally different lexicon opposing trend. 45

- Arabicization

  - Higher education cannot wait for Arabic to become a scientific language in order to be implemented. Will become scientific only through implementation and use. 45

  - Negative effects of foreign languages in education: 47
    1. Same (or whore) excluding elitism as SA
    2. Students do not master the language
    3. Downgrades Arabic

  - Arabic nations or not democratic and elites have no interest in correcting the inequalities caused by foreign languages in higher education. Leaders have studied abroad and inherits negative views of Arabic and only give lip service to arabization. 48

  - The problem will grow more the longer arabization takes.

- Standardization of terminology:
  - Standardization of terminology non existent. Huge problem. Exempls 52
  - Listor p책 termer hj채lper inte eftersom de inte d채rmed kommer i anv채ndning.
  - Lists of terms not helpful since they do not thereby come into use.
    - Syrian academy an exception since new terms are used in higher education. 53
