- "Orthographic depth" developed for differences in European language.

- Many potential components: 23-
  
  1. Historical orthographic inertia
  2. Spelling consistency despite morphophonemic alteration
     - <houses> for */hawzes/*
  3. Omission of phonological elements
     - Vowels in abjad
     - Stress
  4. Dual purpose letters
     - semi-vowels in Arabic
     - <h> as consonant and digraph component (<ch> <ph>, etc.) in English
  5. Diglossia
  6. Graphic considerations
     - *monk* and *come* spelled spelled with <o> to avoid <mu> in Fraktur tapefaces
  7. Lagaturing
     - all pervasive in Arabic
  8. Visual complexity
     - allographs
  9. Non-linearity
     - vertical stacking, e.g., of diacritics
  10. Inventory size

- "these dimension *do not form a single continuum* of orthographic depth. 25
