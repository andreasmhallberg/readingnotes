- 'pure' colloquial and 'pure' standard "in reality do not exist". 72

- Variables moving language closer to the standard pole: 76:

  > i. Setting (formal vs. informal)
  > ii. Topic
  > iii. Speakers’ skills in MSA
  > iv. Emotional state of speaker
  > v. Participants in the discussion
  > vi. Function of the discussion
  > vii. Personal relationship with the audience

- "one-system approach" and "two-systems approach". Uses one-system. 77

- Diphthong has small effect on perceived standardness. Monophthong may be used with standard ending. 80

- Largely similar rankings of forms of *ra’a/shaf* on diglossia scale. 82

- "Speakers accept forms that 'sound right'", i.e. if it appears in other situation, even if here incorrect. 83

- "In creating standard forms [in production], however, the factors in order of decreasing importance are: lexeme, pronominal suffix, inflected verbal suffix, and diphthong." 83
