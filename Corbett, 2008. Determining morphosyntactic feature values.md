- Canonicity measured against "logically possible canonical system" which may not exist in a real language. Canonicity is thus a gradient phenomenon measured in likeness to this hypothetical system. 3

- Critieria for canonical morphosyntactic feature, categorized by principle:

  - Principle I: "Features and their values are clearly distinguished by formal means." Features and their values: 5- 
    - have a dedicated form
    - are uniquely distinguishable
    - are distinguished consistently across relevant word classes
    - distinguished concisely within relevant word classes 

  - Principle II: "The use of canonical morphosyntac features and their values is determined by simple syntactic rules." Canonical use of morphosyntactic features and their values 8-
    - is obligatory
      - "The bare stem will not be interpreted as being outside the case system" 9
    - does not admit syntactic conditions (one simple rule govern case, e.g. direct object for accusative)
    - does not admit semantic conditions 
    - does not admin lexical conditions from the target (governee)
    - does not admin lexical conditions from the controller (governor)
    - sufficient (can stand alone and fill syntactic role, i.e. woth particle or similar)

  - Principle III: "is expressed by canonical morphology" (a one-to-one correspondance between form and function.) 11-
    - Inflectional classes are non-canonical

- Tests problematic cases in Russian for canonicity.
