# Meiseles, Gustav, 1980. Educated Spoken Arabic and the Arabic Language Continuum. Archivum Linguisticum 11, 118-48

- Other scholars "attempt to solve the problem of variation in this linguistic range by delimiting intermediate language varieties, reducing the amount of variation by increasing the number of linguistic systems and sub-systems." 122

- Basically binary system:  "every text, or part of it, cannot help being either LA or colloquially oriented"  123

- Quadroglossia:
  1. Literary (or Standard) Arabic
  2. Sub-standard Arabic [when spoke: OLA]
  3. Educated spoken Arabic.
  4. Basic or plain vernacular.

- Only aiming at methodologically valid classification, not to solve the problem of variation.

- LA is read speech but unusual in improvised speech. "Actual speech in La takes mainly the form of OLA" 124

- SsA defined by Ferguson's words as "an Arab's attempt to speak classical Arabic."  125.

- Functional definition of OLA: 125 

  > it is produced under such psychological and social circumstances as 'dictate’ the prestige language. It is the language generally used for oral expression in the mass media communication.

- Demarcation between ESA and OLA:
  1. OLA has LA vocabulary *ḏaba/rāḥ, raʾa/shāf, allaḏi/illi, sa-/ḥa-*
  2. OLA tendency to restore 'word endings' 
  3. Dual in all parts of speech, dual chains
  4. *lam*+juss and not *mā*+perf
  5. *mabnī li-l-majhūl*. In ESA only in journalist clichés.
  6. *an* and *anna*, while asyndetic in ESA
  7. MSA phonetics, [q], [ḏ], etc.
