- regional dialects "has no written form." 299 [!!]

- Arabic dialects and standard similar result as bilinguals for vocabulary tests and metalinguistic ability. 300

- Dot on letters, e.g., baa and thaa, and different shapes of binding are orthographic complexity. 301

- 3 groups: Arabs reading SA, and Hebrew speakers and Russian-Hebrew bilinguals reading Hebrew.

- Reading test: 304
  1. Text reading - Short text. ["pointed" but unvoweled in appendix.] Time and errors registered.
  2. Single word - Unvoweled words and non-words. "Reading mistakes contained all reading rule violations including wrong vowelization" [Howe does this translate to phonetic variation? *ḥaʾʾ*=wrong?, *warde*=wrong?] 304

- Arabs lower scores on reading but higher in single word reading. Phonological awareness with Arab children not reflected in higher reading skills. Interpreted as complicated orthography. 311

  - But: Mistakes in reading "were mostly inaccuracies related to using false affixes (diacritics or letters) that generally represent the syntactic roles in the sentence and not false identification of the word itself." 312
