- The establishment of Western school system destroyed traditional Islamic education, attracted the elite. Islamic education left to "those of modest and rural origin" 488
  - Islamic education as the "the least attractive option." 508

- Islamic education characterized by rigorous discipline and "lack of explicit explanation of memorized material." 493

- Students did not ask about the meaning of the text and it never struck them to do so. Expected to understand what they read on later stages of education. 494

  > Explicit explanation was considered a science in itself to be acquired only through years in the advanced study of exegetical literature (*tafsīr*).
