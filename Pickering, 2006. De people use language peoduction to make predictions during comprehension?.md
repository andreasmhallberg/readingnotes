- There is consensus that speakers use comprehension to monitor own production. 105

- Simultaneous emulation of perceived bodily motion well documented for motor control. 105-6

> it enchances perception of those actions by predicting what is going to happen next.

- Evidence of involvement of articulation in comprehension: 107
  - activation of tongue and lips when listening to speech.
  - activation of brain areas associated with speech production
  - predictions in conversation when the turns end
  - overt imitation of many language of language in dialogue

- Production running in parallel and simultaneously with comprehension and predicts upcoming material on different levels (phonology, syntactic, semantics). Explains: 108
  - rapid incremental processing of language
  - fast reactions to implausibility 
  - phonological restitution (/æ/ percieved in /her pet /c[noise]t/).
  - failure to detect anomalies in semantic complex sentences ("No head injury is too trivial to be ignored.") Emulation (production) overrides input.
