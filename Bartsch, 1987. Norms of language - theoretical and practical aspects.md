# Bartsch, R., 1987. Norms of language: theoretical and practical aspects, London: Longman. 

- Standard used as benchmark if felt to be same language: 13

  > In everyday speech, correction activity, oriented towards the written word of formal standard, depends on how much one is aware of speaking a language is different from written language.

- In Switzerland and Austria Standard German has small effect on spoken language as they are seen as different languages. Similar situation in Bavaria where the local dialect has prestige. 14

   > In other Germans states, where there is less feeling of tribal or regional identity, correction of spoken language to conform to Standard German is accepted in all school situations and by the people of middle and higher social strata.

- Some varieties are dialects since they are "superseded by the norms of the standard language in nearly all situations of public life." 14

- "in Germany, a person who does not use the case markings correctly is considered unfit for for any white-collar job. Different word order is more accepted" 15

- Variation in linguistic norm because it is mostly implicit: 141

  > These differences are caused not only by different private, social, regional, and cultural surroundings in which somebody is formed as a social being, but also by the fact that these norms are not in general explicitly formulated, but have to be learned from examples and models, which leave different generalizations and interpretations open.
