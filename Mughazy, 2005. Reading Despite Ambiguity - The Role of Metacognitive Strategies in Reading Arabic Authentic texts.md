# Mughazy, M., 2005. Reading Despite Ambiguity: The Role of Metacognitive Strategies in Reading Arabic Authentic Texts. al-’Arabiyya, 38/39, s.57–74.

- Bottom-up (decoding) and top-down (context) strategies are assumed to be used in equal measures in proficient reading. 59

- Arab readers of English use more top-down strategies than native English readers. Strategies they bring from reading Arabic. 59

- Characterization of difficulties of reading in Arabic. 62-3

- In experiment
  - Native speakers
  - reading isolated sentences with homographs, words revealed one by one, with
    - no vowel markers
    - correct vowel markers
    - misleading vowel markers
  - Results
    - In isolated initial word with correct vowel diacritics there was 26.7% mistakes, with misleading vowels there were 49.4% mistakes. *Readers did only partially take in vowel information*
    - very small difference in error rates for sentences with no and misleading vowel diactritics. 65
    - Some informants reported that they did not notice that there were misleading vowels. 67
    - "Think aloud protocol": speakers relied on word frequency rather than on vowels
      - first word most likely a verb
      - Stemform I more likely than II
  - Speakers did less mistakes at the end of sentences, since the there have more contextual knowledge. 65

- Icraab not reproduced in read speech: 70

    > The participants in this study did not attempt to reproduce case marking when the short vowels were missing, and they ignored them when they were present regardless of whether they were accurate or misleading.
