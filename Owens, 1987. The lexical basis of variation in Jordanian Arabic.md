# Owens, J. & Bani-Yasin, R., 1987. The lexical basis of variation in Jordanian Arabic.  Linguistics, 25(4).

- All spoken SA är ESA:
  1. SA Super (or 'dummy’) high
  2. ESA (1, 2, 3)
  3. Col

- SA as a 'dummy high' variety 706

  > 'refers to speech varieties of which some of the members have a certain knowledge, and which are given prestige rating by the speakers ... but which are not in fact utilized extensively in any domain' [...] We would suggest that within the domain of spoken (but not written) language, SA is a 'dummy high'.

- "The 'super’ high can theoretically serve as a target in the spoken language, though in fact its function is rather to contribute various lexical and grammatical attributes which mix with the Col variety in the formation of ESA." 706-7

- SA features picked up in Col. Historically leading to smaller gap between them. 729

- SA head + SA or Col concordant  
  SA head + Col (SA*) concordant. 731
