# Beeston, A.F.L., 1970. The Arabic Language Today. London: Hutchinson.

Below from chap. 7, "Syntactic Markers on Nouns"

- Poor general proficiency in case system [this is still exaggerated]: 53

  > At the present, only a small sector of the highest educated Arabic-speaking population is capable of using the [case] system with complete confidence in extempore, unprepared, diction.

- Case endings are redundant: 54

  > The partial or entire elimination of i’raab does not in fact entail significant loss of comprehension, since the markers are to a large extent redundant.

  > One is obliged to admit that the system is to a considerable extent an ornament of diction rather than functionally necessary.

- Only practical function of icraab is to mark the agent. In some cases unclear also with icraab. Gives example  *ra’a akhi musa*. [Doesn't hold up. This would always be SO according to traditional grammar. Cf. Bayṭār.]


- In discussion in beginning of 20th century about using dialect as standard middle way was proposed: so away with icraab. Beeston argues against this. 54-55
