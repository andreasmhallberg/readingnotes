# Kissine, Mikhail, Xavier Luffin, Fethia Aiad, Rym Bourourou, Gaétane Deliens, and Naoufel Gaddour. “Noncolloquial Arabic in Tunisian Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Possible Instance of Language Acquisition in a Noninteractive Context.” Language Learning (2018).

- 25% of children with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) never acquire a functional language. 2
- Difficulties with social interaction hindered language development.

- Preschool and early school children with ASD speaking MSA is a "relatively frequent" observation. 2

- Of seven children 5 used MSA in ~ 40-50% of utterances. Roughly half completely MSA. 10

- glossed examples

- Conclusions:
  - MSA in the speach of children with ASD is real. Used in 39% of utterances. 19
  - Use of MSA is productive. 
  - Likely acquired from non-interactive/non-social input: TV and video games. Preferred form of input for language with these children. 20
