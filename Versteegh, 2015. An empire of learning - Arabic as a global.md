# Versteegh, Kees. 2015. “An Empire of Learning: Arabic as a Global language.” In Language Empires in Comparative Perspective, 41–53.

- English as dominating "global" language not unique event. 43

- Regional languages of learning sometimes have no speakers:
  - Sumerian
  - Latin
  - Sanskrit

- Prestige of language of learning connected with education. Elites have no interest in denying its value. Cultural capital. 44

- Foreign languages of leering not always imposed by freight elite. Sometimes self-imposed. 45

- Position of Arabic as language of learning in Europe: 34
  - Established in 11-12th centuries
  - Marginalized role of Arabic: 46
 
    > after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Arabic as the source of all wisdom had lost all of its glory, and in Europe the role of Arabs and Arabic became restricted to an exotic corner of academic Orientalism. 

  - Displaced in Renaissance with renewed respect of Latin and Greek. 47

- In non-Arabic Muslim communities Arabic source of legitimacy and respect. More inched than traditional broad language of learning.
