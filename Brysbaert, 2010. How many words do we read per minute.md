- Widely cited rate of 300 wpm is not supported.

- 238 wpm (for English) based on 190 studies. 5
  - 260 wpm for fiction. 15,21

- (International Reading Speed Texts)

- Changes in reading speed over life span. 15-
  - Slower for children, increased in college years, decrease with old age (resulting in different reading strategies) 

- No clear evidence that reading speed affects comprehension. 17
  - Some evidence that fast readers comprehend slightly better.

- L2 readers slower. Eye-movements similar to those of L1 children. 19

- Differences between languages. 19-
  - Reading speed reviewed for reading speed (15 studies for Arabic)
    - Arabic: 181 wpm
    - Swedish: 218 wpm
  - Differences can be accounted for by differs in informational content (amount of words needed to convey same content.)
  
- No evidence for "gears" except normal reading and skimming. 21
  - Reading for recall (studying) is slower, not due to different reading rate, but for rereading and saccades.

- Reading speed in line with speed of speech comprehension. 22
  - No need in the basis of speed data to assume different comprehension processes.
