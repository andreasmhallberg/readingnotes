Below only form chap. 3. "The Linguistic Practice of the Arabis"

- When SA became the written form it could no longer be spoken: 78

  > The lapse of Classical Arabic from spoken use probably corresponds quite closely to the point where it became fully a written language – were illiterates no longer mastered it and the norm was set by written style to which formal speech might make an effort to conform.

- Dialects seen as having no grammar: 81

  > The inflectional grammar of the written language is regarded as a work of art, whereas Arabs are often unwilling to recognize that the dialects have any grammar, but see them as chaotic deviations from the sacred norm." 

- Only CA and foreign languages are legitimate languages for culture and learning: 81

  > Since C1A (sic!) is the only form of the language which is normally written, it is pragmatically the only way to access (except for European languages) to any form of education or culture or to any participation in the national life outside the local scene. 

- No awareness of case in reading: 81-2

    > [...] most Arabs, when they are dealing with printed material, do not maintain an awareness of the grammatical functions which would be necessary in order to read it out loud correctly.

- "In general, modern written Arabic accommodates to the dialects by the selection of forms that are not dependent on short vowels for their understanding, whereas 'classicazing' and the search for a loftier style take place in the lexical range". 85

- Number grammar is fictional: 86

  > For all practical purposes, the number system [som beskrivs in grammatiken] does not exist in oral use of C1A – the short vowel patterns are a myth and the speaker uses simplified forms current in his own dialect for numbers above ten, even though he though he may be able to write the correct consonantal skeleton.
