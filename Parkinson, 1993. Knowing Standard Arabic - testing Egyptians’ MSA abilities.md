# Parkinson, Dilworth, 1993. “Knowing Standard Arabic: testing Egyptians’ MSA abilities”. Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics V, 47-73

Grammar and proficiency test (reading, writing, speaking, listening) in MSA.

- Complete sociolinguistic description of MSA must encompass 
  1. prescriptive system
  2. part of communicative continuum 
  3. "imperfectly known, but fully functional, part of most Arabs' communicative lives".

- "I will claim that the system of i’raab [...] is not a viable part of most Egyptians' MSA." 48

## Grammar test
- distributed to 170 participants, balanced for  sex and education. 49-50

- Test items from 1st and 2nd year [Western] Arabic curriculum. 50

- Even HiAr Higher education with Arabic specialization fail other than most simple school-book like sentence structures. [Seem to learn case in phrases.] 54, 58.

- University studens hoover around 40-60% correct on case marking.

- Description of case-less MSA on TV. Consisten *-iin*- forms etc. 59

  > when the goal is merely to communicate, people do not fell at loss.

- *iʿrāb* not practically useful: 60

  > It makes little difference to most of these people weather they can accurately identify some obscure grammatical structure [...] but it makes immense difference to them weather they can read the newspaper easily enough to do it constantly.

## Proficiency test

- Tests the four skills.
  - [Artificial and  awkward test situation for oral production:] 63

  > In the speaking test, each subject was told that they were to pretend to be in a country where only MSA was spoken.

- Total test time 2.5 h. 64

- HiAr gets 3 of 5 overall: 65 

  > 3 in productive skills no longer makes constant grammatical errors, and produces text that would be taken by most to be example of MSA, although usually without significant vowelling.

- Education most important predictor of test scores. 67

- Accept texts without *iʿrāb* as MSA. 71

- MSA integrated part of Arabic: 71

  > MSA certainly appears to be experienced by its users as simply the formal version of what they do every day, the upper end of their style spectrum, as opposed to experiencing it as a separate form.

- 'Levels' cannot be described in and of themselves since they are always interacting. 72

- Concluding programmatic statements: 72

  > We probably must redefine the functional role of parts of the grammatical system, such as the I’raab vowels, looking at possible social and stylistic purposes instead of simply assuming that they play only a grammatical role.

  > We must discover an appropriate language for talking about a form with such a range of manifestations, and with such a clash of overt and covert norms and expectations, so that we can characterize what people actually do on TV cultural programs, for example, in addition to simply pointing out its deficiencies in terms of the descriptive system.
