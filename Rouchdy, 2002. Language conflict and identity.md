- Study of Arabic speakers in Detroit "the largest concentration of Arabs outside of the Arab wordl." 133

- Speakers in two extremes: 135
    - who speak speak only Arabic
        - piginized form of English used in business transactions
        - living in predominantly Arab areas
    - who speak only English
        - Arabic vocabulary limited to to mainly food items and curse words
    - in between with various degrees of bilingualism

- Borrowing of nouns with article assimilated. eg. *iddoor*, *ishshooz* 137

- Highly educated tend to codeswitch more than semi-educated who borrow, and retain English pronunciation of borrowing. 137

- Verbs are second most borrowed category (after nouns). Contrasts with previous studies of borrowing. 138
   - *fakkasna assayyaara* 'We fixed the car'
   - *kalniit il-beet* 'I cleaned the house'
   - *kolmi bukre* 'Call me tomorrow'

- Adjectives are note inflected for gender when codeswithced. Inflecting the adjective would be ungrammatical. 140
    - *inti laki* 'You (f.) are lucky (m.)'

- Standaard arabic as an ideal is a unifying force of Arabic speakers. 143
