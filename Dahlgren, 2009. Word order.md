# Dahlgren, Sven-Olof. 2009. “Word Order.” In Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, edited by C. H. M. Versteegh, 4:725–36. Leiden: Brill.

[Largely a summary of Dahlgren's (1998) disseration.]

- Uzbekistan Arabic has SOV as default word order (Versteegh (1984-89)). 727

- Sentences with all three constituents (VSO) are minority
  - "Approximately only every third or fourth sentence contains an independent subject in written and spoken Arabic." 
  - ~3% in Ibn Isḥāq contain independent V, S, and O. 727

- Forground/background
  - In Ibn Isḥāq no difference in word order. Marked instead with *wa-* and *fa-*.
  - Spoken varieties lack *wa-/fa-* for forgrounding/backgrounding [!].
  - In Eastern dialects VS/SV marks fg/bg. Deviations due to focusing/topicalization. 729

- Odd word order in the Quran
  - OV (17:20). 731
  - VOS (20:76). 732

- SV more common with imperfect than perfect verbs. 733
  - VS almost 100% with punctual perfect verbs, definite subjects in foreground.
