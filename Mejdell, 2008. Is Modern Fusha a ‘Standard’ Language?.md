*Fuṣḥā* is a standard variety comparable with standard varieties in other languages.

- Too much focus on diglossia 41

  > As arabists with a non-Arabic background, we tend to study Arabic as a highly specific sociolinguistic case, stressing the 'diglossic' situation whenever we discuss models to account for observed linguistic behaviour.

- Many standard languages have the language of the elite as "standardization base". Not all. Cf. Czeck Republic and Swizerland. No part of population speaks standard: 45-6

  > The result is, that in these language communities, then, no section of the community has the standard as natural spoken variety (as 'mother toungue'). The standard variety as the 'norm of linguistic correctness' is considerably more divergent in grammatical structure from the vernacular varieties.

- "the intellectuals of the cultural and linguistic renaissance restored and revived the codified variety of the past" 45

- Codification not equal to standard: 47

  > Most researchers in the field in fact argue that although codification is as necessary property of of a standard language, the codified norm, as prescribed in grammar systems and dictionaries, is not necessarily identical with the standard as it is *used*. [...] This is especially true with regard to spoken use. 

- I Czech and Swiss-German "the standard varieties do not even have validity for spoken use, apart from some restricted functions" 48

- International trend of 'restandardization' in semi-formal speech with spread of audio-visual media. 49
