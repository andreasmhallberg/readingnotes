# Zaki, Mai. 2017. “Corpus-Based Teaching in the Arabic Classroom: Theoretical and Practical Perspectives.” International Journal of Applied Linguistics 27 (2):514–41.

- Long intro on the usefulness of corpora in language teaching
    - cites Sinclair (1991) that is is "an absurd notion that invented examples can actually represent the language better than real ones."

- Very good, hands on example of how to use <arabicorpus.com> with the *Al-Kitaab* textbook.
    - vocabulary building with word after 522-527
    - exploring grammar with word after (e.g. word after *ʿidda*, takes iDaafa in pl.) 527-137 
    - for intermediate: insect concordances 532-537
