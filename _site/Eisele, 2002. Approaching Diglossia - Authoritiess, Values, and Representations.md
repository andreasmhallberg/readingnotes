# Eisele, John 2002. Approaching Diglossia: Authoritiess, Values, and Representations. In Language Conflict and Language Contact in Arabic. Ed. Rouchday, Aleya. Cambridge University Press.

Analysis of view on diglossia through Western/moder vs. Arabic/traditional discourse. Interesting discussion of Western Arabists prescriptivism.

- Arab/traditionalist values. 6-7:
    1. Unity – opposed to [regional] variation. Motivated by Islam, thereafter nationalism
    2. Purity - origin
    3. Continuity – opposed to change
    4. Competition – with other languages, Turkish and Farsi, then European languages.

- Modern linguistic values. 10:
    1. Vitality
    2. Native speaker
    3. Descriptivism – against prescriptivism

- Critique of the ESA project. 14-16:
    1. Mitchell (1980) describes levels, which he criticizes in others.
    2. Contradictory relation to fuzzyness. Ex. El-Hassan criticizes Ferguson for not recognizing fuzzyness but insists that ESA is not a level. 
    3. ESA's relation to dialect and MSA not made clear. Sometimes dependent on them (as a syntactic basis) and sometimes independent of them.
    4. El-Hassan argues that ESA is rulebound but borrows Labov's "inherent variabilit".
    5. El-Hassan and Mitchell each other with regards to MSA negation and icraab as defining factor in ESA.
    6. Mitchell suggests ESA as prescriptive model. 

- Critique of Kay, 16-17:
    1. Word choice that downgrades SA. "Ill"/"artificial"
    2. Prescriptive-dialect as standard/Latin script.

- About Parkinson 17-19:
    1. Ideological argumentation with values of modern linguistic: 18
        > However, in using ’vitality'  'variation' as the basis for his arguments, Parkonson is also DEFINING HIMSELF AWAY FROM Arab traditionalists. What he terms 'variation' (and hence 'vitality') is another man's 'ill-defined' (hence 'artificial' as in Kay) is still another’s 'mistake' (hence in need of prescriptive rules), as in the Arab-traditionalist viewpoint.
    2. "traditionalist and classical bias" 19 since he evaluates proficiency by classical norm. [But he is clear that this is only one form of benchmark. Talks of "mistakes" with clear quotation marks.]
    3. Regards dialect and SA as parts of the same system with fits with the traditionalist value of UNITY.
