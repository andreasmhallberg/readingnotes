# Jaeger, T.F., 2008. Categorical Data analysis: Away From ANOVAs (Transformation or not) and towards Logit Mixed Models. Journal of Memory and Language, 59(4), s.434â€“446.

- ANOVA has several flaws for categorical data analysis:
    - Confidence intervals outside of proportions of 0 and 1. Ascribes probability to events that cannot occur. 435
    - Binary factors SEs larget around p=.5. Not captured in ANOVA. 436
    - Unreliable also when transformed for p close to 0 or 1. 441. Transformations of ANOVA data was made to save made to save data power. No longer needed. 442. 

- Logit models as linear regression in log-odds space. Captures binary categorical distribution. S-like shape when non-logit. 437

- Interpretations of coefficients. Slope of 1.35 log-odds = e^1.35 = 3.9 = four times higher. 440
