# Retsö, J., 1993. ’Iʿrāb in the Forebears of Modern Arabic Dialects. Actes des premières journées internationales de dialectologie arabe de Paris, pp.333–342.

- Questions whether the development of modern dialects is that of morphological reduction similar to that in Romance, as if often claimed. 334

- Main arguments:
    1. Not a development to a analytic from a synthetic language. Exemplifies with passive and *iḍāfa*. 335
    2. Mode system not directly derivable from CA. Some dialects have *-īn/-ūn* and some have *-ī/-ū*. 336
    3. Doubtful whether CA case system is similar to proto-semitic. 237
    4. Phonological explanation for the disappearance of endings vowels does not hold up. Ex.: *huwa*/*hiya*, final *-a* for *tāʾ marbūṭa.* 339 Change stricter SVO may be unrelated, is it was in Hebrew. 341

- CA may be from one branch of Arabic and modern dialects from another. 342
