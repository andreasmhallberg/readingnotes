# Parkinson, Dilworth, 1994. Speaking Fusha in Cairo: the role of the ending vowels. In Arabic Sociolinguistics, 179-211. Ed. Suleiman, Yasir. Surrey: Curzon Press.

Detailed description of a few speakers use of vowel/case endigns. 

[Why study the SA of speakers who never use it and make no claim of knowing it.]

- Ambiguous case vowel in 'elision sites' is ignored unless it is obvious [?] that it is meant to be icraab. 181

- Strong preference with all to produce *a* in perf3m.s. Cannot be incorrect. 183

- Uneducated speakers use accoasional vowels withoyt relation to syntax in order to mark their speech as SA. 185 
    - One speaker: "'if you want to vowel something, use /a/'". 192 

- Possible memorized frozen expression with icraab. 187

- Words with enclitic pronoun often case vowel. 191

- Indite more often marked than construct state in idafa. 191, 200

- Numbers not inflected as nouns. 192

- Longer analysis of speaker with prescriptively correct speech. ”utterly unique”, 207

- Conclusion: 
    - Icraab necessary marker of SA but difficult: 207

    > It is clear that all speakers, when they decide to do *fuṣḥā*, whether for just a part of a sentence or for a whole exchange, use the ending vowels along with other *fuṣḥā* markers to indicate what they are doing. Most use them just occasionally, sprinkling them through their text at a certain rate to give the flavour of *fuṣḥā* without making it so difficult on themselves they would not be able to speak at all.

    - Proficient speakers aim lower than formally correct speech so as not to seem distanced/pedantic. 209
