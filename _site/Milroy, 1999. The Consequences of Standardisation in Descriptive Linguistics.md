    > In extreme cases [of standardization efforts … ] the tone is quasi-religious -- even apocalyptic: it envisages a battlefield in which the forces of good and evil fight for supremacy and in which there is an evil conspiracy gnawing at the root of society.

    > The authoritarian nature of orthodoxy is clear in the underlying assumption that hundreds of millions of fluent native speakers cannot be trusted to use their own native language.
