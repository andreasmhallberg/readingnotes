# Ehri, L.C., 2014. Orthographic Mapping in the Acquisition of Sight Word Reading, Spelling Memory, and Vocabulary Learning. Scientific Studies of Reading, 18(1), pp.5â€“21.

- Strategies for decoding unfamiliar words: 6
    1. *decoding strategy* - single graphemes to phonemes
    2. *analogy* - finding in memory similarly spelled and pronounced word (*thump-jump*)
    3. *prediction* - use initial letters plus context to guess rest of word.

- *sight reading* - seeing known word directly activates it in memory. May operate on word or syllable level. Greatly facilitates reading compared to other strategies.

- Phases in reading development: 7-10
    1. *prealphabetic phase* - rely mostly on salient visual and contextual cues to read words.
    2. *partial alphabetic phase* - use sounds of letter names to decode words.  Similarly spelled words often confused. Vowels often lacking.
    3. *full alphabetic phase* - complete mappings between graphemes and phonemes. Sigh-reading of monosyllabic words.
    4. *consolidated alphabetic phase* - sight reading of whole words, common morphemes and syllables.

- Phonetic awareness enhances word reading and spelling. 10

- Word memory stored with articulation. 10

- Knowledge of letter names facilitates for beginning readers. 11
