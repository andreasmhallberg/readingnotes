# Greif, Esther Blank, and Jean Berko Gleason. 1980. ‘Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye: More Routine Information’. Language in Society 9 (2): 159–66.

Experiment on parents explicit instruction to children to use politeness formulas.

- Investigates how parents impart the routines of *hi, thanks*, and *goodbye* to children. Elicitation of routine from children and prompts from parents. 160
    - 22 children, 2--5 years old. One session with each parent. 

- Much less likely to produce *thank you* than *hi* or *goodbye*. 161

- Children repeated parents prompt verbatim, indicating that they did not understand what it meant. 162

- 21 of 22 parents provided promoting. 164

- No differences in promoting boys and girls. 164

- Important for socialisation: 

    > These formulas mark the speaker as an appropriate member of pur society, and failure to perform them or some variation of them is the sign of an eccentric or bizzare person. 165

    > While a child might get by in the world without ever using the passive, or even a common lexical item like *ball*, the child who does not learn to say *hi, thanks,* and *goodbye* will become a despised member of society. 166
