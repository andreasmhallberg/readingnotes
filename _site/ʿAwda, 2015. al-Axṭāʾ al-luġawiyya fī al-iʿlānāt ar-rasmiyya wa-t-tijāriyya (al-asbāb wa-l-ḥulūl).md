# ʿAwda, Ṯāʾir Yūsuf, 2015. al-Axṭāʾ al-luġawiyya fī al-iʿlānāt ar-rasmiyya wa-t-tijāriyya (hg-asbāb wa-l-ḥulūl). In al-Muʾtamar ad-dawlī al-xāmis li-l-luġa al-ʿarabiyya. Dubai: al-Majlis ad-dawlī li-l-luġa al-ʿarabiyya, pp. 160–166. Available at: http://www.alarabiahconference.org/.

- The linguistic mistakes on shop and information signs are  "خطر يهدد اللغة العربية ويشوّه مظهرها الهام" 160

- Those responsible aught to be punished. 160

- Material gathered from students taking pictures of signs. 160

- Type of errors (with lists with examples):

    1. Spelling [typographical], e.g. not differentiating between *al-qaṭʿ* and *al-waṣl*
    2. Grammatical (e.g. wrong case in sound m.pl., *yāʾ* in defective verbs)
    3. Constructions 162
       - Arabic is characterized by a richness in forms and expression, and this is not used in signs. It is rare to see in signs:
           - *maṣdar mīmī*
           - *ṣifa mušabahha*
           - *asmāʿ az-zamān wa-l-makān wa-l-āla*
           - *afʿāl at-taf¬dīl*
           - *jamʿ al-kaṯra*
           - *ṣīġat at-taʿajjub*
    4. Use of the  dialect
    5. Foreign words with Arabic letters, e.g. سوبر ماركت
    6. Foreign words wit foreign letters (here *tarjama ḥarfiyya*) 163
    7. Use of signs completely in English
    8. Typographical [spelling] errors
    9. Unintentionally funny names.

- Problem lies with: 
    - Calligraphers, many of whom are Pakistanis and do not speak Arabic.
    - People responsible for the signs, i.e. shop owners etc.
    - Mass media who propagates errors.

- Solutions:
    - Encourage Arabs to take up sign making.
    - Hire language inspectors and fine linguistic perpetrators.
    - Shop license include language tests.
