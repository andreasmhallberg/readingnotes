# Meiseles, Gustav, 1977. Restitution of ‘word-endings’ in Modern Literary Arabic.  Israel Oriental Studies 7:173-95

- MLA (i.e. MSA) has become a medium of oral communication the last 15 years. 175

- Icraab is grammatically superfluous. 174 "OLA, as in general MLA, has produced and produces analytical devices which enable it to dispense with the residential endings." 180

- Speakers are keen to restore endings to raise their speech from the dialect. 175

- "the rather complicated system of these CA endings." 175

- Icraab is highly valued in the education system. 176. "condition sine qua non of CA"

- Word endings are proffered: 177 
    1. preceding *waṣla*
    2. before enclitic pronoun
    3. in construct state

- Dialects have one connecting rules (epenthesis). Two systems interacting in spoken SA. 177

- Pause forms thoroughly described but positions unclear. 177. Fot 21

- Free use of endings in pause. 178 So widespread it cannot be considered a mistake, part of the new system. 179

- "Regenereation" of case system. Stylistic and not syntactic. 179

- Srabs cannot use ucraab in fluent speech. 180

- Correct icraab first minutes of speech. Then more mixed ways of speaking. 180

- Två möjliga sutuationer : A talaren känner att han vet ändelsen och uttaler den då. B: talaren vet inte vilken ändelse och uttalar inte. 180 Jfr. Badaw (1973)
- Two possible situations: 
    1. speaker knows the ending and then he pronounces it. 
    2. speaker does not know the ending and then he does not pronounce it

- List of common errors by CA norms that "are so frequent that we have to regard them as (at least potentially) regular features of OLA [i.e. Oral Literary Arabic], and not as pseudo-corrections." 181-84
    1. diptotes inflected as triptotes 
    2. use of NOM instead of ACC, especially after *kāna* and *laysa* 
    3. overuse of lexicalized *-an* adverbs. 182-184
    4. overuse of indicative. 184

- Impossible to know if icraab vowel: 184-185
    1. with enclitic pronoun –*ak*/*-ik*
    2. Vowel in word boundaries, e.g. preceding article

- Talare undviker ibland besvär genom att lägga till vilken vokal som helst men ändå höja sig från dialekt. 185 Jfr. Parkinson.
- Speakers sometimes add any vowel regardless of case as a means of raising from the dialect. 185 [Cf. Parkinson 1994]

- Schwa often used. 185

- New grammatical system: 185 

    > As the process of restitution of 'word-endings' occurs in OLA under very different conditions than that of the original CA norms of occurrence and use, it is highly important to reinterpret the facts independently of the usual prescriptive way.
