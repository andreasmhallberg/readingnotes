# Corriente, Federico. 1973. “Again on the Functional Yield of Some Synthetic Devices in Arabic and Semitic Morphology (A Reply to J. Blau).” The Jewish Quarterly Review 64 (2):154–63.

- Facts:
    1. "*Iʿrāb*-Arabic dialects must have existed side by side with *Iʿrāb*-less dialects." 155
    2. Middle and Low Arabic wihtout exception *Iʿrāb*-less. 156
    3. In texts with Iʿrāb "inflection endings are dealt with in a very peculiar manner", dropped in pause, etc.
    4. Iʿrāb-less varieties or Iʿrāb-fluctuation is scandalous for traditional accounts.
    5. Account for facts by posing low functional yield in early Arabic.  

- Alternative explanation that all modern derived varieties dropped case endings. 

- Functional yield of case in Classical Greek 61%. 162
