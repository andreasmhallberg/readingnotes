- Four steps of standardization (Not necessarily in this order): 993
    1. Selection
    2. elaboration
    3. codification
    4. acceptance

- During renascence standardization of languages part of development of nationalism. 925

- Nation building: "internal cohesion---extern distinction" 928.

- "As the ideal goals of a standard language, codification may be defined as *minimal variation in form*, elaboration as *maximal variation in function.*" 931

- Chimerical goal of stopping change: 931

    > In practice, such fixation [stoppage of language change] has proven to be chimerical, since even the most stable of norms inevitably changes as generation come an go. At all times the standard is threatened by the existence of rival norms, the so-called 'dialects,' among its users.

- Rigid codification makes language unusable: 932

    > A codification may be so rigid as to prevent the use of a language for other than formal purposes. Sanskrit had to yeald to Prakrit, And Latin to the Romance languages, when the gap between written and spoken languages became so large that only very few people were willing to make the effort of learning them.
