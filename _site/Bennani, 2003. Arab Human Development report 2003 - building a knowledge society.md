- "Arabic language classes are often restricted to writing at the expense of reading." 7

- "facility with the English language is waning across the Arab world". 124

- Arabic pedagogy in crisis, traditional pedagogy: 125

    > The teaching of Arabic also suffers from an acute crisis, both in curricula and methodology. The most apparent symptoms of that crisis include: concentration on  the superficial aspects of teaching grammar and morphology, rather than on core concepts of texts and their respective holistic structures; inattention to semantics and meaning; neglecting the functional aspects of language use, such as improving linguistic skills in everyday use; limiting language classes to writing rather than reading; abstaining from using conventional lexicons, (which are admittedly difficult owing to the juxtaposition of new and old entries and explanations without distinctions); and the inadequacy of pedagogical research in language teaching.

- "the prevailing methodology that the Arabic school follows in teaching the language still emphasises memorisation and rather than the acquisition of dynamic, renewable knowledge." 125

- Language reform[?]: 125

    > This is why linguistic research is vital. It requires establishing language centres, new dictionaries incorporating words common to both colloquial and classical Arabic, functional scientific dictionaries, the Arabisation of scientific terms, the gradual simplification and rationalisation of grammar leading to a median language that neither lapses into colloquial nor replaces that rigid old structures that are difficult to use.
