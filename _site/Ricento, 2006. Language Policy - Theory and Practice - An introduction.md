[Arabic language ideology is your garden variety standard language ideology.]

- Standard language ideology ubiquitous: 20

    > Regardless of their inability to halt language change and maintain the "integrity" of the national language, academies, dictionaries, and language departments in universities, contribute to the belief (or myth) that there *is* a standard, correct, "fixed," language (English or French or Spanish, etc.), and that students must go to school to "learn" their native language. 

- Standard language ideology hinders social mobility but is invisible, and no one speaks it: 20

    > yet it is a policy which is largely hidden from view because it most citizens accept is as logical, natural, fair, and efficient when, in fact, it is none of those things, since *no one* speaks the (mythical) standard variety, and *everyone* speaks some variant of one or another language variety.
