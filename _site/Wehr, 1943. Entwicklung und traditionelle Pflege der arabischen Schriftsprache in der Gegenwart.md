# Wehr, Hans. 1943. “Entwicklung Und Traditionelle Pflege Der Arabischen Schriftsprache in Der Gegenwart.” Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 97 (1/2): 16–46.

- Knowledge in classical grammar and lexicon in high regard. 16

- Maintenance of the purity of Arabic and adherence to classical norm "eidens der wesentlichen Gebiete des geistigen Lebens." 16

- Ideal is to make Arabic suitable for expression in modern topics without deviating from classical prescriptions. 19

- Some modern and liberal thinkers have very conservative language. Ṭāhā Ḥussayn, Bišr Fāris. 21

- The ultraconservative ideal of some scholars is not represented in modern prose. 22

- Allusions to classical literature, of which much is known by heart by educated Arabs, and the skill and subtlety by which these are employed, are an important part of the evaluations of authors. Much of this will go the Western Arabist by. 24

- Characterization of modern prose, follows classical grammar and loanwords and dialectal words are strictly avoided: 24

    > der Wortschatz gierft genr of frühe Autoren zurück und bewegt sich bei nachclassischen und modernen Worten und Bedeutungen in der Regel in de Bahnen der zulässigen Analogie, meidet jedenfalls streng Entlehnung aus der Ungangssprache sowie ersatzbare Fremdwörter, die äußerst verpönt sind.

- While expansion of lexicon through loanwords is intensely debated, the large amount of claques of European phrases go completely unnoticed. "für user Gefühl viel stärker gegen den Geist der *ʿarabiyya* verstoßen" 24

- Voices raised again to strict view of language. Mixāʾīl Nuʿayma, Salāma Mūsa. 26

- Approaching the European "Sprachgeist" 28-9

- Poor pedagogy makes student despise Arabic classes. 20

- Language of journalists and clerks have far more influence on the language that that of learned scholars, since their texts are spread and are practically applied. 31

- No normative published by Egyptian academy, which contributes to "die Heute im Wortschatz herrschende Anarchie". 33

- Authors use *ad hoc* neologisms and meanings. No standardized lexicon as in modern European languages. 34

- On the compilation of modern lexicon for Arabists (i.e. Wehr)
    - Traditional philologists' assessments of commonly used words can not be taken inter consideration. 35
    - Include words even if "unarabisch" [?] 36
    - Dialectal loans. Specifically of concrete things, e.g. tools, animal and plant names, terms for craftmanship. 36
    - **The main problem for compilation of modern Arabic lexicon: in order to display classical education authors use old and rare words. Therefore there can be no backwards historical limitation for words that are no longer in use. 57**  

- Syntactic developments: 
    - Iḍāfa with inserted adjective. eg. قائد عام الأساطيل الجوية. This happens when the noun+adjective pair is a specific term that cannot be broken. Often solved with *li-* 38
    - *iqḥām* 39
    - *law* for indirect questions. 39
    - Nisba-adjectives without feminine ending. Originates from dialects. 39
    - Nouns in acc. as prepositions: 40
        - ʾabra
        - šaṭra
        - ṭarafa
        - asfala
        - qayda (under [investigation])
        - rahna (under [reign])
        - qisra (against [will])
        - ḥāla (like)
    - Influence from noun preference in European languages leads to overuse of maṣādir 41

- Remarkable that the classical [morphological] norm has been retain through the centuries. Dialectal intrusions that have been common in writing have not been normative. New phraseology is free to develop as long as it retains classical commonly known morphology. 43

- Modern Arabic not faulty classical Arabic: 44

> Nur eine wirklichkeitsfremde Betrachtungswiese kann in der heutigen arabischen Schriftsprache eine mit Fehlern durchsetzte *ʿarabīya* sehen.
