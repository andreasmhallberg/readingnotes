# Furayḥa, Anīs, 1955. Naḥw ʿarabiyya muyassara. Dār aṯ-ṯhaqāfa fī bayrūt.

[Large parts of the book consist in presenting modern linguistic principles for an Arabic readership: language change is normal and inevitable, common usage should be normative, no language is better than other languages, etc. Argues, for instance, that the dialect does have syntax. Focus on icraab in discussion of the problems with SA.]  

- When speaking SA one is forced to focus on linguistic form rather than content. 19

- *Fuṣḥā* and *ʿāmmiyya* aught to be seen as two separate languages. 21

- Absence of icraab in speech precedes geographical expansion of Arabic. 106

- *Fuṣḥā* and *ʿāmmiyya* are felt to be one language only by Arabs since they have learn to use both interchangeably. They are two for foreigners and children. 118

- People did not master icraab at the time of the Prophet. 124

- [Seems to only mean case when referring to icraab. 114, 126]

- Case is in and of itself outdated [!].  123

- Diglossia has negative psychological and moral effects. 153-6. [Section with nonsense.]

- The idea that the dialect is linguistic corruption builds on the faulty assumption that *fuṣḥā* was once a spoken language. 172

- Icraab is mere decoration:  173 

    > الاعراب ليس لها قيمة بقائية بل هو زخرف لغوي

- Suggests ESA as new written language. 181. [Equates ESA with *ʿāmmiyya*.] 193

- Proposes the use of the Latin alphabet. 189. 

- Three points to describe ESA 183:
    1. no icraab
    2. common norm
    3. relies on *fuṣḥā*
