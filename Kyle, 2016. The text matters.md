# Scherr, Kyle C., Stephen J. Agauas, and Jane Ashby. “The Text Matters: Eye Movements Reflect the Cognitive Processing of Interrogation Rights.” Applied Cognitive Psychology 30, no. 2 (2016): 234–41.

Eye-tracking experiment to test comprehension of different versions of arrest rights.

- Eye movements are automatic. 235

  > In fact, if you try to control your eye movements while reading the rest of this paragraph, you will expediency how unnatural it feels.

- Global measures fixation duration and number of fixations increase with cognitive effort. 

- Eye tracking prefferable to other types of measurements of cognitive effort in reading: 236
  - measures events that occurs on reading itself rather than button press or recall test.
    - little individual variation resulting from test strategies
  - temporal resolution gives data of reading as it "unfolds"
  - reading as it occurs naturally outside of laboratory
  - participants read at their own pace and can look where they want in a sentence
  - unlikely to be affected by reactivity or desirability bias

- Presents data on
  - fixation times
  - total number of fixations
  - comprehension tests

- More difficult text more difficult to comprehend [Surprise!]
