- Discussion of previous reasearch
  - Ni et al. (1998)
    - Control, pragmatic anomaly, and syntactic anomaly. 
    - No effects on fixation measures, probably due to difference in lengths in target words.
    - Difference only in rate of regression.
  - Braze et al. (2002)
    - differences in length in target word and in word following target word. 

- Stimulus
  - Manipulation: 1292
    - Control: *John used the knife to chop the large carrots for dinner.*
    - Implausible: *John used an axe to chop the large carrot's of dinner*
    - Anomalous: *John used a pump to inflate the large carrots for dinner*
  - Target word always a minimum of five characters to increase the chance of it being fixated. 1293
  - Three lists
  - Yes/No questions only after stimulus sentences.

- Results:
  - Target word fixated 95% of the time during first pass. 1293
  - Maesurments:
    - First fixation duration
    - single-fixation duration
    - gaze duration
    - go-past time
    - total reading time
  - Some effects on pro target region. Discussion of n+1 effects. 1294
  - Target word:
    - No difference in
      - first fixation
      - single-fixation duration.
    - Difference in
      - gaze duration
      - go-past time
   - Pots target region
     - Difference in all measures
     - Much higher rate of regression for anomalous (3%, 6%, 23%)

- Largest effects for anomalous sentence. 1299
