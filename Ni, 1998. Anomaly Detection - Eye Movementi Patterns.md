Investigates eye movements in syntactically and pragmatically anomalous sentences.
 
- Small garden-path sentences may be common in ordinary text but readers recover quickly and are unconscious of them. 516

- Hypothesis:
  1. pragmatic anomalies lag behind syntactic anomalies. 518
  2. pragmatic anomalies are less severe than syntactic anomalies. 522
  3. percievers react differently to pragmatic and syntactic anomalies. 523

- Methodology problem with anomalies in stimuli in that subjects may come to "distrust the experimental stimuli, so normal processing routines may not be tapped." 524

- 24 subjects.

# Stimuli
- Triad of stimuli sentences, identical except for verb which makes them syntactically anomalous, pragmatically anomalous, or normal. 525

  > It seems that the cats won't usually eating/bake/eat the food we put on the porch.

- Examples:

  > a. It seems that the cats won't usually *eating* the food we put on the porch.
  > b. It seems that the cats won't usually *bake* the food we put on the porch.
  > c. It seems that the cats won't usually *eat* the food we put on the porch.

- 30 target sentences and 76 fillers, some of which anomalous, at least one filler between target sentences. 256
- Comprehension questions following 20 randomly selected sentences.
  - All participants at least 90% correct. 257
- Practice session prior to experiment, after which subject could ask questions. 257

- Differences between syntactically and pragmatically anomalous sentences significant.
- "Syntactic anomalies caused an immediate, but short-lived, spate of regressions." 532

- Analysis
- regions (AOIs)
  1. beginning (0--3 words)
  2. subject
  3. modal verb + adverb
  4. critical verb plus next word, regardless of category
  5. next two words regardless of category
  6. remainder of sentence (0--4 words)

# Results
  - First pass reading time: 530
    - syntactic anomaly: no effect anywhere in the sentence.
    - pragmatic anomaly: longer on regions 5 and 6.
  - Regressions: 531
    - syntactic anomaly: increase on
      - region 4 (cont=.58, syn=.197) and
      - region 5 (three words down the line, con.=.88, syn=.292).
    - pragmatic anomaly: increases the further down the sentence you go. Highest at end of sentence.

  - Different effects for pragmatic and syntactic anomalies: 532

    > Syntactic anomalies caused an immediate, but short lived spate of regressions. By contrast, the effects of pragmatic anomaly included both slower forward reading times and increased regressions; both weak at first but became progressively stronger as the sentence continued.


# Conclusion

- Readers tend keep reading to resolve sentence in pragmatic, but not syntactic anomalies. 533
- Similar results in Perlmutter, Garnsey, and Bock (1995)
