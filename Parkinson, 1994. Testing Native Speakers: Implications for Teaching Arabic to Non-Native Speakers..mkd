    > many, particularly highly educated subjects, have developed one or more strategies to make their output different from colloquial, in essence, to make it look more like fuṣḥā (but by definition derivative of colloquial).

- Pedagogical implications

    - Assumptions: 200
	1. Study time is limited.
	2. You get better at what you actively practice.
	3. Student motivation is communication and practical use.

    - Case has always been central in Arabic teaching in the US. 201

    - Fokusera grammatikundervisning på de markörer araber faktiskt använder för att höja till fusha. För detta måste man inte bara veta preskriptiva former utan också hur dessa faktiskt anävnds. 202
    - Focus on the forms Arabs actually use to raise their speech from dialect to fusha. 
	- To do this students must know not only prescriptive forms but also how to use them. 202

    - "what Arabs do is Arabic" 203

    - "if we keep the educated speaker as our guide, we are erectly justified in making the kinds of simplifications the he himself makes." 203
