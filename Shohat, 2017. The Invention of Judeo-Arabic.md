# Shohat, Ella. 2017. “The Invention of Judeo-Arabic.” Interventions 19 (2):153–200.

- Judeo-Arabic constructed as "a cohesive unit separate from Arabic": 155

  > The various vernaculars of Arabic deployed by Jews have increasingly come to be identified by a rubric that underlines their  Jewishness and sidelines their Arabiness.

- Earlier orientalist discourse categorized Arabs and Jews as 'Semitic' peoples. After Haskala and Zionism "scholars began to project Orientalism" exclusively toward Arabs, giving Arabic speaking Jews an ambivalent position. 158

- Arabic speaking Jews always referred their language as 'Arabic', also when printed printed with Hebrew letters. 158
  - *Qanun al-Nisa'* seen as model of Judeo-Arabic, but its author called the language *lafdh 'arabi*. 170 



- Iraqi Jews in diaspora in India, Burma, China and Hong Kong "faithfully maintained its own iteration of Arabic culture".

- 19th century - newspapers in Arabic in Hebrew writing in India. 160

- Arabic printing with Hebrew writing gradually waned in Israel where Jewishness became connected with nationality: 162

  > That the Iraqi-Jews in Israel maintained this Arabic-in-Hebrew-letters printing traditions far decades after their arrival is thus quite remarkable, especially given the state-apparatus' policing of Arabic and its exclusively utilitarian mobilization for intelligence and military aims. Gradually, indeed, the general decline in Arabichas had evertying to do with associating Arabic with a rival nationalism, and thus with the taboo language of 'the enemy'.

- The label Judeo-Arabic is a "retrofitting" of the language spoken by Jews to fit new idea of Jewishness as debarked from Arabness. "'Judeo-Arabic' is not *really* Arabic". 162
 
- Linguistic studies have 163
  - contrasted Arabic spoken by Jews with neighboring variants, picturing them "utterly different" from surrounding Arabics
  - compared the Arabic spoken by Jews of geographically different areas, ascribing "inherent comparability" to them

- Yiddish as the model of a 'Jewish language', how it is distinct from majority language (i.e. German). 164

- Yiddish better fitting than Judeo-Arabic to modern nationalist Jewish identity: 165

  > Yiddish has also become the hegemon's alter ego. It is a language now imbued with nostalgia and a sense of historical belonging, especially giving the new movement of modernized/'de-Semitized' Hebrew becoming Israel's national language.
 
- Judeo-Arabic as "a kind of *non-Arabic Arabic* of Jews." 166

- Acknowledged as a language separate from Arabic, e.g. in Fullbight applications. 166-7

  > out of all of Arabic's myriad regional, ethnic and religious speech variants and dialects, it is only one version---'Judeo-Arabic'---that is regarded as an isolatable language.

- Orthography (Hebrew) as making Judeo-Arabic separate language not tenable. 167

- Jewish-Baghdadi narrated as Jewish but could more appropriately be re-narrated as a regional variant (Muslawi) inserted into Bagdad through Jewish immigration. Fits linguistic and historical facts. In Mosul speakers of all confessions use these features . 175--7
