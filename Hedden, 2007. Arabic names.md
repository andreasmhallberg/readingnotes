- Transliteration
  - Arabic names keep first transliterated form once they have entered English language texts. C9

  > Personal names that were first intrudes into English through the press, rather than through books, tend to assume a more popular romanization.

  - North African and Lebanese names introduced through French keep French spelling, e.g. Chadli Ben Jadid. C9
  - Differences in spelling depending on whether based on local pronunciation, e.g. Q/Gadaffi. C9
  - List of transcription standards. Varies depending on degree of precision. C10

- Indexing
  - Double-postings are not needed in specialist literature where readers are familiar with alternative spellings, but are in trade books. C11
  - Sort by the name by which the person is best known. Repeated uses in text.
  - Invert surnames and father's names. C12
  - Definite article *al* ignored in sorting when separated with space or hyphen.
  - *ʿAbd* and *Abu* used for sorting and not separated from following word.
  - Classical *Ibn* capitalized and used for sorting. Standard practice - no double-posting. Modern surnames do not begin with *ibn* but may begin with *bin* or *ben*. C13
