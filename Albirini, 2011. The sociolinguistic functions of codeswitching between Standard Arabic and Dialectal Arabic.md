# Albirini, A., 2011. The sociolinguistic functions of codeswitching between Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic.  Language in Society, 40(05), ss.537–562.

- How DA and SA are used indexes their status. Variation not by domain but by uses within domains. 

- [Typology of CS function poorly defined. Lots of types can also be other types.]
 
- CS does not mean that the status of/attitude towards variates are changing or that L takes the place of H. 

- Switches to SA
    1. Formulaic expression 541
    2. Importance of segment 542
    3. Explanation. 542
    4. Quote.
    5. End joking 544
    6. Rhyme 545. Only example is a quote.
    7. Take the role of an expert 545
    8. Arab/Islamic identity. 546

- Switch to DS
    1. Parenthesis 547
    2. Deemphasize (signal negative attitude) 548
    3. Indirect speech
    4. Simplification/explanation 550  [Also give as reason to switch to SA]
    5. Examples from real life
    6. Comedy
    7. Taboo subjects. 553. [Illustrated with poor example. *Šuyūx* often do not have problems to speak openly about sex.]
    8. Dialectal saying.
    9. Insult. [Same as negative attitude?]

- The indexcality of SA and DAs is conserved through such use. 555

- SA and DA is distributed fictionally rather than contextually. 559
