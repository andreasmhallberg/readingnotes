- There is a trade-off in writing system between the needs of the beginning read of *decipherability* and the need of the skilled reader of *unitizability*. 444

- Vowel letters introduced in Hebrew int the 10th and 9th centuries BC. 445

- Diacritic vowel signed named *nikud*, lit. *pointing*. 445

- Switch back to using unpointed writing in 19th century as Hebrew was revived as spoken language. "This demonstrates that an abjad with minimal vowel marking is well suited to the needs of the native Heberw-speaking reader."

- Two versions of Hebrew orthography: pointed and unpointed.

- Some difference between the phonology as represented by pointed forms and the phonology of spoken language, together with the smaller shapes of pointing "may encourage the reader to pay less attention to the vowel signs." 446

- 25--40% of words are homographic.

- Unpointed Hebrew not "deep" in the same sense as English. In English letters have several sound, in Hebrew signs are missing.

- 3 phases of Hebrew reading development
  1. *Phonological/sub-lexical phase*
     - ends in 2nd grade
     - The advantage of pointing in accuracy for reading aloud narrows after 2nd grade and disappears at end of 3rd grade. 447
     - Knowledge of vowel signs decline over first 3 grades. [!]
  2. *Lexico-morpho-orthographic [sic] phase*
     - Take syntactic environment into consideration to resolve homographs.
     - Children become less accurate in reading pseudowords with non-existent patterns (Gur, 2005). 448
