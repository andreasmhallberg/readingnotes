# Saiegh-Haddad, E. & Schiff, R., 2016. The Impact of Diglossia on Voweled and Unvoweled Word Reading in Arabic: A Developmental Study From Childhood to Adolescence. Scientific Studies of Reading, 0(0), pp.1â€“14.

- Two sets of vowel marks: 3
  1. *phonemic diacritics*: word internal - necessary for lexical access.
  2. *morpho-syntactic diacritics:* word final (case and mood) - not necessary for lexical access.

- Morpho-syntactic diacritics are optional. Case is complicated. 3

  > not required for word identification or for reading comprehension. This is apparent by the fact that all readers of Arabic are skilled in reading unvoweled Arabic, whereas only a small minority of them master the complex system of rules that are captured by the morpho-syntactic diacritics.

- Earlier research (Abu-Rabia) did not differentiate between the two types of voweling. Found that voweling increased accuracy but not comprehension. 3
  - Only morpho-syntactic vowels used here.

- Independent role of two types of diacritics: 3-4

  > A true understanding of the role of novelization on reading accuracy and speed in Arabic, as well as in lexical access and comprehension, requires, an understanding of the independent role of the two systems of Arabic diacritics: phonemic and morpho-syntactic.

- Sublexical (phonemic/syllabic) word processing in inexperienced readers, lexical processing in experienced readers. 4

- Experiment: 4-5
  - 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th grade; 20 part each
  - Read words with 
    1. identical form in SpA and StA
    2. words in that exist in Sta but not in SpA
        - Cognate - phonemic differences from Spa
        - Unique - no counterpart in SpA
  - Words matched for:
    1. phonemic length (3 to 12)
    2. syllabic length (1 to 5)
    3. orthographic length (3 to 10)
    4. word familiarity (judged by language experts)
  - Outcome variable: 5
    - accuracy: accurately read words/total words
    - fluency: nr. of words read in first 45 s.

- Results and discussion:
  - Accuracy and fluency higher for SpA words in all conditions, all ages. 8
  - Vowelled texts is not shallow orthography: "the assambled phonological form of the words does no, in many cases, align with the SpA form that speakers harbor in their lexicons" 9
  - Fluency higher in unvowelled text. Vocalization "summons undue phonological recording of diacritics" and hinders "morpho-orthographic mechanisms" used in reading normal, unvowelled text.
  - Reading proficiency develops earlier for SpA - reading instruction should start in SpA. 11
