- Problems with traditional statistics: 226
  1. cannot provide evidence for invariance/null hypothesis. Yet this is often of theoretical interest.
  2. overstate evidence against null hypothesis

- In traditional statistics one cannot provide evidence for the null hypothesis by increasing sample size.

- *Marginal likelihood*: *p* of likelihood. Totals to 1 for all hypothesis.

- *Bayes factor*: ratio of marginal likelihoods. M0/M1

- Priors
  - In practice often good to set Bayesian prior to 1. 228
  - Two schools in setting priors: 229
    - Subjective: researcher set priors in accordance with their own beliefs and available data.
    - Objective: priors reflecting as few assumptions as possible.
  - Results not very sensitive to reasonable differences in priors. 233

    > In genera, researchers may differ in their choice of priors. If these differences are reasonalbe, they will have nonly modest effects on the resulting conclusions.

- Recommendations for Bayesian t tests. Formula for which *n* and *t* can be inserted to get Bayes factor. (pcl.missouri.edu). 226, 23


- Bayes factor favors alternative hypothesis (not null) for larger sample size. This is desirable: larger sample makes it possible to find very small effect, i.e. not null.

- Hypothesis testing is often over-used. Often enough to plot estimates. Hypothesis testing best if null hypothesis is theoretically interesting. 235

- Call to dispense with the illusion of objectivity that p-tests lead to. 235
