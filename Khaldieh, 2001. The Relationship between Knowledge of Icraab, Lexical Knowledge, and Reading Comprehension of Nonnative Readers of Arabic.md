# Khaldieh, S.A., 2001. The Relationship between Knowledge of Icraab, Lexical Knowledge, and Reading Comprehension of Nonnative Readers of Arabic.  The Modern Language Journal, 85(3), ss.416-431.

Knowledge of icraab no significant effect on L2 reading comprehension.

- Readers are expected to use full case marking when reading aloud and not doing so is an avoidance strategy: [This is probably not an avoidance strategy but a convetion.] 419

  > In reading aloud, an educated native speaker is expected to pronounce words fully with their proper endings, that is, reading aloud requires a complete knowledge of icraab especially in the absence of vowels in most literary texts. When delivering formal speeches, broadcasting or lecturing, a reader must be able to assign not only the right grammatical category to a word but also the right case ending (icraab). Nonetheless, many educated native speakers lack a complete knowledge of icraab or of the grammatical categories of written words. As a result, many native speakers read Arabic texts with a pause at the end of each word due to their deficient knowledge of Arabic grammar. It is apparent that reading with pausal endings on words is an avoidance strategy used as a safeguard against embarrassment.

- Icraab traditionally large role in Arabic teaching. 149. Suggests that it be introduced late. 427

- Icraab should be seen as a back-up mechanism with ambiguities. 426

- Vocabulary more important for reading comprehension and should be prioritized in teaching. 426
