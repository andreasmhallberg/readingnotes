# Talmon, Rafael. 1985. “Who Was the First Arab Grammarian? A New Apporach to an Old Problem.” Zeitschrift Für Arabische Linguistik, no. 15: 128–45.

- *axbār* names three persons as founders of grammar (*awwal man waḍaʿa n-naḥw*): 131
  - Abū al-Aswad ad-Duʾalī
  - ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān bin Ḥurmuz
  - Naṣr bin ʿĀṣim al-Layṯī

- Tendency in early tradition (2nd and 3d centuries) to include diacritization in grammar (*naḥw*). 135

- Tendency to gloss over or harmonize *axbār* on who was the first grammarian has made for a confusing situation. 137

- Similar tendency as in *fiqh*:
  - schools project back using *isnād* to earlier figures. 140
  - In this process Abū al-Aswad ad-Duʾalī was favored because he was associated with Baṣra.

- Cannot currently assess traditions.
