## Case

- Case has no functional load in Quran: 17

  > The number of cases where the inflection [iʿrāb] is meaning-bearing and in which there would be a real chance of, say, subject being confused with object, compared to those where it is not, is minuscule.

- "Pause is defined (rather vaguely) as an audible break in delivery" 63
  - Comes to depend on speech style and use of pauses. 64

- Case plays no disambiguation role in Modern Arabic, the grammatical tradition notwithstanding. 173

## Language level

- Intermediate forms: 344
  - "The 'semiformal' variety mentioned by Ferguson, with its basically L syntax and generous admixture of H vocabulary and phraseology"
  - "a kind of substandard H hose syntax, morphology, and lexicon is H but whose phonology is L-influenced and omits most H inflections. Nonetheless, native speakers still think of this as H."

- Explanation and summary of Badawi's levels: 345-8
  - qualitative border between 2 and 3. 246
    - 2: "its morphosyntactic base remains grammar-book *fuṣḥā*"
    - 3: "its syntactic systems---in particular word order, expression of mood an aspect, negation, an concord---remain nonstandard"
  - 2 is written and read aloud, 3 [non-standard base] is extempore speech. 347
    - [Has to revert to calling spoken MSA "level 2/3" when describing actual interview/panel discussion. 356, 358]  
  - Mort Cirenes "not employed as television news casters and the like" rarely have occasion to *produce* level 2. Only passively exposed to it.
