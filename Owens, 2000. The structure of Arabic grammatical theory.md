# Owens, Jonathan. 2000. “The Structure of Arabic Grammatical Theory.” In History of the Language Sciences, edited by Sylvain Auroux, 1:286–300. Handbücher Zur Sprach- Und Kommunikationswissenschaft. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.

[Good, concise overview of what is stated in the tite.]

- Arabic grammatical theory is "a structuralist edifice *par excellence*" 286
  - Sets out a limited number of positions/categories
  - Each position defined by a set of characteristics.
  - Members may deviated from these characteristics but still fit the class, making members a heterogeneous group.
  - Makes it possible to have a small number of categories. 
  - Members may be characterized by how typical they are for the position.

- *naḥw* and *ṣarf*
  - given roughly equal space in grammars
  - *naḥw* seen as more central, can mean grammar in general sense, including *ṣarf* 288

- Syntactic positions 290-1
  - u-inflected [*rafʿ*]
    1. *mubtadaʾ*
    2. *xabar*
    3. *fāʿil*
  - a-infelcted [*naṣb*]
    1. *mafʿūl muṭlaq*
    2. *mafʿūl bihi*  
    3. *mafʿūl fīhi*  
    4. *mafʿūl maʿahu*
    5. *mafʿūl lahu*  
    6. *ḥāl*          
    7. *tamyīz*       
    8. *istisṯnāʾ*    
  - i-inflected
    1. *muḍāf ilayh*
    2. *majrūr*
  - agreement
    1. *ṣifa*
    2. *tawkīd*
    3. *badal*
    4. *ʿaṭf*
    5. *ʿaṭf bayān*
  - verbal predicate

- "No fixed term for syntactic position." 291
  - *mawḍiʿ* and *margin* sometimes use
  - Typically, a word is said to occupy a named position.

- Government is causal between words: 292

  > The Arabic conception of governance is causal: the verb brings about the different infelctional forms of the nouns.

- Unchanging theoretical core after 900: 293

  > later grammarians operate essentially with the same categories as did Ibn as-Sarrāǧ. [...] Thinking in terms of concentric circiles, the important later developments in Arabic linguistic thought may be represetned as adding new conceptual circles around the relatively fixed core of morphologically and syntax.

- *Ṣarf*
  - *Naḥw* is the study of context dependent word forms, *ṣarf* of words in isolation, their "essence". 293
  -  consonantal root (*aṣl*) plus additions (*ḥurūf zāʾida*)
  - Status of short vowels implicit, sometimes part of form, sometimes not
  - Verbal suffix *-tu* is prononoun, but *a-* (1so) is not, to retain VS syntax. Syntax took precedence over morphology. 296

- *aṣl* and *farʿ* 297
  - Used to explain why some forms deviate from features of category.
