# Hermena, Ehab W., Denis Drieghe, Sam Hellmuth, and Simon P. Liversedge. 2015. “Processing of Arabic Diacritical Marks: Phonological–syntactic Disambiguation of Homographic Verbs and Visual Crowding Effects.” Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 41 (2):494–507.

Vowel signs ("diacritics") on passive verbs are processed when only the verb is vowelled, otherwise it is not


- Fully vowelled text gives slower reading speeds (+75 ms gaze duration, Roman and Palvard 1987). 496

- Disruption measurable in disambiguation region for garden path sentenses (Frazier & Rayner 1982, Liversedge et al. 2002, Murray & Liversedge 1994). 496

- Survey of printed text shows that show that active verbs are never vowelled, passive verbs are vowelled if not disambiguated by directly surraounding context. 596

- Increased visual crowding results in slower identification of the word (first fixation) (Paterson & Jordan 2010, Slattery & Rayner 2013). 497
    - word spacing


- Participants
    - 25 participants
    - read text aloud to control proficiency. 499

- Stimuli 499
    - 40 targets, 60 fillers
    - Font: Traditional Arabic
    - not monospaced
    - sentences rated for naturalness
    - allowed to take breaks
    - comprehension questions followed 25% of sentences
    - conditions:
        - active verb no diacritics
        - active verb full diacritics
        - passive verb no diacritics
        - passive verb diacritics on verb
        - vassive verb full diacritics

- Analysis
  - Longer gaze duration, first and single fixation, gaze duration in Pass-Full-D than in Pass-Verb-D. Do not process diacritics on passive verb is sentence is fully vowelled. 501
  - 7 ms longer fixation duration in fully vowelled text. 503
  - Age and trail number had no effect. 503

- Garden path effects in disambiguation region of in unvoweled and fully vowelled, but not if only ambiguous verb is vowelled. 504
   - skilled readers have a default preference for interpreting verbs as active
   - do not process vowels in fully vowelled text. 505

    > The small effect, likely due to visual crowding and the fact that there were no other differences between the two active conditions [no vowels and fully voweled] (similar total number of fixations and total sentence reading times), lends more support to the suggestion that readers do not engage automatically, or at any significant extent, in cognitive process to access the linguistic information provided by the diacritics in full diacritization mode.
