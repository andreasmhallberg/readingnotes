# Rayner, Keith. “Eye Movements and Attention in Reading, Scene Perception, and Visual Search.” The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 62, no. 8 (2009): 1457–1506.

- Eye movements can be dissociated from attention but are in reading and other complex tasks tightly associate. Attention shifts in a single fixation used to plan saccades. 1458

- Reading (English) 1459
  - fixations around 225 ms in silent reading
  - saccades round 2°, 7-9 letters, and take around 30 ms 

- Visual field 1459
  1. *foveal*: central 2° Best vision. Move eyes to place object in foveal vision.
  2. *parafoveal*: 5°
  3. *peripheral*: beyond parafoveal

  - "viewers move their eyes so as to place the fovea in that part of the stimulus they want to see clearly."

- Eye movement measures in reading do not correlate with eye movement measures in scene perception.

- Letter spaces appropriate length measure in reading as long as text is of normal size. 1460

- Reading 1460
  - average fixation about 200--250 ms
  - average saccade size is 7-9 letter spaces (English).

- *regressions*: backtracking eye movements 
  - 10--15% of all saccades. 
  - very long saccades (15-20 letters) are often after regression since readers skip past segment they have already read.
  - often a few letters long to correct too long forward saccade 
  - most regression to immediately preceding word
  - longer saccades due to readers not understanding. Good spacial memory for regression landing.
  - regression not very well understood because it is difficult to control them experimentally

- "difficult to encode fonts" yield longer fixations, shorter saccades, more regressions

- Poor, beginning and dyslectic readers make longer fixations, shorter saccades and more regressions.

- Denser orthographies yields similar fixation durations and regressions but shorter saccades (Chinese 2--3 characters, Hebrew 5.5 characters). 1461

- Measurements of processing
  - Fixation duration good global measure but poor local measure of processing because of
    - skipping 
      - content words are fixated 85% of the time, function words 35% of the time.
      - likelihood of word being fixate increases with word-length. 2-3 letter words fixated 25% of the time, word of 8 or more letters almost always fixated.
      - skipped words are probably processed during fixation of preceding word
    - refixation on long words
    - Three measures used together on single word analysis:
      - *First fixation duration*: duration of first fixation regardless of other fixations on word.
      - *single-fixation duration*: those where only one fixation are made
      - *Gaze duration*: sum of all fixation prior to saccade to following word.
    - Units longer than single word
      - first-pass reading time
      - second-pass reading time
      - go-past time (first entering area to leaving it to reading onward)
      - total reading time

- Rereading a text gives: 1462
  - similar fixation patterns
  - shorter fixations
  - saccades longer
  - fewer regressions

- Perceptual span: 
  - 3-4 letters to the left from fixation, 14-15 letters to the right from fixation
  - For Chinese 1 character to left and 2-3 to the right.
  - For Hebrew asymmetry of perceptual span reversed.
  - If readers have the fixated word and the word to the right of it normal and rest jumbled they are not aware that the text is changed and reading speed is 10% slower.
  - No information gathered from line below.

- Preview benefit
  - When readers have a valid preview of a word (not blocked in experiment) fixation time is reduced 30--50 ms. 1466
  - information on letter position, abstract letter codes, orthographic codes, and phonological codes are accessed through preview benefit, but semantic is not. 1467
  - No intergration of morphological information in English but in Hebrew.
  - If the fixated word is difficult to process preview benefit to the right deminishes.

- Word spaces (word length) most determining factor for saccade length. 1469
  - Saccade length influenced by length fixated word and word to the right of fixation.
  - When spaces are removed reading slows down by 30%.
  - Word spaces may improve reading even when orthographically incorrect.
    - Word spaces introduced between words in Thai, three-lexeme compound words in German.

- Where to land in word 1470
  - *Preferred viewing location*: where fixation in word is typically made. Halfway between beginning and middle of word.
    - Genrally assumed that readers attempt to fixate center of word but saccade falls short.
  - *Optimal viewing location*: where fixation time is shortest.
    - Center of word.
    - Studied experimentally with isolated words.
    - The further fixation is form optimal viewing location, the more likely that the word is refixated. Effect also in reading.
    - For every letter fixation deviates from optimal viewing location, processing increases with 20 ms. Effect smaller or absent in reading.

- Skipping 1471
  - word length and contextual constraint biggest effect.
  - if a word is skipped it is probably processed in previous fixation. Fixation times inflated before skipping.

- Word processing 
  - Fixation time affected by: 1472
    - word frequency
    - word predictability
    - number of meanings
    - age of acquisition
    - phonological properties
    - semantic relation to prior words
    - word familiarity
  - Perception shorter than fixation, needs only 50-60 ms. 1473
    - if word disappears 50-60 ms. after fixation reading proceeds normally.  
    - if the word to the right also disappears reading is disrupted.
  - Longer fixation for disambiguation words in garden-paths
  - Longer fixations at end of clause or sentence.
  - Longer "quite immediate" longer fixation on anomalous word.

- Eye-movement data "golden standard" studies of sentence processing. 1474
