# Albirini, A. 2014. “The Role of the Colloquial Varieties in the Acquisition of the Standard Variety: The Case of Arabic Heritage Speakers.” *Foreign Language Annals 47* (3): 447–63.

- Aims: 452
    - Do heritage speakers (HS) have an advantage over L2 learners even in areas with no overlap between MSA and colloquial Arabic.
    - Do HSs retain a potential advantage in advanced levels
    - negativ/positive transfer form colloquial to MSA

- Experiment: elicitation of negation in: 453
    - verb present
    - verb past
    - verb future
    - verb imperative
    - verbless

- Participants: 452
    - L2: n=28, third or forth year of collage-level Arabic
    - HS: n=35. Two groups
        - EH - first first semester of collage-level Arabic
        - AH - second or third year
     - L1 control group
     - [No first year L2 participants. Inter alia assumed to have 0% accuracy in grammar test.]

- Overall accuracy: 454
    
    - HE begin studies with advantage but looses it.

|         | number | overall mean accuracy | SD    |
| :-      | :-     | :-                    | :-    |
| EH      | 19     | 23.55                 | 19.44 |
| AH      | 16     | 78.13                 | 16.49 |
| L2      | 28     | 69.73                 | 17.89 |
| Control | 16     | 97.81                 | 4.27  |

- L2 no transfer errors. 475

- Mixing with colloquial regarded as errors. 457  

    > the advanced heratage speakers produced a substantioal number of errors through borrowings from, or swithces to, colloquial Arabic.

    - [Target language is a fictious "pure" standard arabic. Control group produced near 100% "correct" Standard Arabic, but this is likely due to test condition promoting "school language" percieved as correct, not real-life Standard. Were transfer from colloquial regarded as correct EH overall mean accuracy would be around 70% and HE 77%.]

- Conclusion: convergence of proficiencies in higher levels means that heritage speakers have not had opportunity to advance. 460
