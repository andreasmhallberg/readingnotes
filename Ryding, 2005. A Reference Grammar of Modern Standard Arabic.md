> [This gramamr] centers on the essential of modern written Arabic likely to be encountered in contemporary Arabic expisitory prose.

## Case

- Arabic as normally inflected for case: 54

  > Arabic nouns and adjectives normally inflect for three cases: nominative, genitive, and accusative.

- In writing case endings are present even if not: 166

  > The Arabic case-ending system consists primarily of short, word-final vowels, *which are invisible* in conventional written Arabic texts. [...] The Arabic case system, then, remains mostly hidden from view in written text and is apparent only when the text is read out loud with complete pronunciation of all vowels. [Emphasis in original.]

- None use of case markers in reading aloud described as "pause form". 167n51

- Reading aloud with case endings is a specialist skill. The degree to which learners need to learn it depends on goal. 167

- Eight nominal declensions. 184-

## Misc

- Cites Sibawayh to show that *maʿa* is not a true preposition: "*dhahab-a min maʿ-i-hi*" 393

- *-an* ending on defective nouns. 29
