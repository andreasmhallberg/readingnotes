- Aim: xviii

> [This grammr] centers on the essential of modern written Arabic likely to be encountered in contemporary Arabic expisitory prose.

## [Pracitices of case inflection]

- Arabic as normally inflected for case: 54

  > Arabic nouns and adjectives normally inflect for three cases: nominative, genitive, and accusative.

- In writing case endings are present even if not: 166

  > The Arabic case-ending system consists primarily of short, word-final vowels, *which are invisible* in conventional written Arabic texts. [...] The Arabic case system, then, remains mostly hidden from view in written text and is apparent only when the text is read out loud with complete pronunciation of all vowels. [Emphasis in original.]

- None use of case markers in reading aloud described as "pause form". 167n51

- Case inflection in language learning 167

  > The degree to which they [learners] need knowledge of explicit case marking rules depend on the structure  and goals of particular academic programs, and on the goals of individual learners.

- Often not used in reading aloud: 167n51

  > In reading written Arabic aloud, some narrators read most of the words in pause form, omitting desinential infelctions.

- Eight nominal declensions. 184-

## Misc

- Cites Sibawayh to show that *maʿa* is not a true preposition: "*dhahab-a min maʿ-i-hi*" 393

- *-an* ending on defective nouns. 29
