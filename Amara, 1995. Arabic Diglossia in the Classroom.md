# Amara, M.H., 1995. Arabic Diglossia in the Classroom: assumptions and reality. Israel Oriental Studies, 15, ss.131â€“142.

- "Educated Spoken Arabic is the variety most used, with shifting to the local dialect and, in a few cases, to Standard Arabic." 134

- Higher awareness of SA in Arabic classes, but failure to uphold it. 136

- In Arabic classes answers from the book are given in SA. When they themselves formulate answers, ESA or dialect is used. 136

- Male student attempt to use SA more than girls. 138

- Contradicts "assumptions held by many people in the Arab world that SA is the only variety used for education." 139
