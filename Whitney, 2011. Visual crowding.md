# Whitney, David, and Dennis M. Levi. 2011. “Visual Crowding: A Fundamental Limit on Conscious Perception and Object Recognition.” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 15 (4): 160–68. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2011.02.005.

- Definition: "the inability to recognize objects in clutter" [in the visual periphery]. 160

- Characteristics
  - Impairs identification, not detection
  - Objects are perceived as having high contrast but are jumbled together.
  - horizontal flankers (distractors) give more crowding effects.

- Crowding gives an averaging of features of objects.

- Dissimilarity between target and flanker (size, color, orientation, etc.) reduced crowding. 164-5

- Crowding can occur on high-level representation, eg. faces. Upside down faces reduce crowding form target face.
