Review of Arabic sociolinguistics.

- Breakingpoints:
  1. Fergusons diglossia
  2. Womens use of non-standard. 67

- "The study of the spoken languages remains largely confined to foreign researchers." 65

- MSA â€“ standard/prestige, differences to Western standard languages. Not directly related to social class. "In fact, often the higher one's social class, the less likely it is that one will learn it [SA] well." 68

- "Given the fact that the symbolic values of Classical and nonclassical Arabic are multiple and contradictory, their use and nonuse is not simply a question of knowledge and access." 69

- Spread of mass education "lead to concerns about the 'difficulty' of the grammar and orthography of Classical Arabic." 71

- Debate on language reforms (grammar or writing system). 71-72

- Grandguillauma on MSA as without cultural foundation, "translated world". 73

- Social reproduction of MSA? 74
