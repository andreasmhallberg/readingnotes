# Sadan, Arik. 2015. “Sībawayhi’s and Later Grammarians’ Usage of Ḥadīṯs as a Grammatical Tool.” In The Foundations of Arabic Linguistics II, edited by Amal E. Marogy and Kees Versteegh, 171–83. Brill.

- *ḥadīṯ* "recieved scant mention in the early grammatical tradition." Causes: 171
  - recognized not to transmit exact wording
  - many transmitters non-Arabs

- Case study in data in discussion of *naṣb*: examples from poetry, sayings of Beduins, and Quran totalling hundreds. Hadith only a few. 180

- *Ḥadīṯ* started to be quoted by grammarians in 12th century.: 180-1

> Since later grammarians had less access to informants of Old Arabic, which was the aim of their investigations, they seem to have had recourse to other sources, thus quoting more verses of the Qurʾān, more lines of poetry, and in addition, using *ḥadīṯ* too.
