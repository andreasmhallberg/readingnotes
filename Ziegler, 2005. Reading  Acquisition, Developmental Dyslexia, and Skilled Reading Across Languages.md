- Phonological awareness strongly predictive of reading development. 4

- Children master, in order, 4
  1. word level segmentation
  2. syllable segmentation (3-4 year)
  3. onset-rhyme (4-5 year)
  4. phonological segmentation
     - Acquired only with literacy instruction, irrespective of age

- Reading acquisition varies markedly across languages
  - depending on
    1. orthographic (spelling-phonemic) consistency
    2. Grain-size
    3. Teaching methods
  - En of first grade, correct % reading of familiar words (Seymour et al. 2003)
    - Greek, Finnish, German, etc. > 90%
    - Danish 71%
    - English 34%
  - Children learning to read languages with inconsistent orthographies need to develop strategies operating on larger gain-sized than phoneme (rhyme, whole word). 12
  - English children reading pseudo-words
    - more affected than German of whole word phonology when 
    - more reliant on vocabulary knowledge
  - English children learn to read more slowly. Finnish children 90% accuracy after ten weeks, English children at age 9 och 10. 13

- Phonological development after literacy tuition
  - Phonological skills tied to orthography affects phonological processing (e.g., difficulty among adults to omit forth phoneme in *rich* but not in *pitch*). 15
  - Phonology fused with orthography 15

    > phonological representations become amalgamated with orthographic representation as literacy is acquired.

- Dyslexia is deficit in phonological representations.

- Grain size-theory: phonological structure and orthographic consistence leads the development of different reading strategies: 18

  > The development of reading is grounded in phonological processing. Because languages vary in phonological structure and in the consistency with which that phonology is represented in the orthography, there will be developmental differences in the grain size of lexical representations and reading strategies across orthographies. Accordingly, the lexical organization and processing strategies that are characteristic of skilled reading in different orthographies may be affected by differing developmental constraints

  - For languages with simple syllable structure (CV), onset-rhyme segmentation (which emerges before reading tuition) is the same as phonological segmentation, and reading acquisition is more easy. 19

  - For languages with inconsistent or unavailable phonological orthographic representation, more units need to be learned, making reading acquisition more difficult: 19

    > When small grain-size correspondences are inconsistent (e.g., English) or not available (e.g., Chinese), beginning readers have to learn additional correspondences for larger orthographic units, such as syllables, rimes, or whole words.

- Theories on reading acquisition and skilled reading have developed independently. But structures in reading development, as conditioned by grain-size, leaves foot prints that lingers skilled reading, and must be taken into account in these theories.
