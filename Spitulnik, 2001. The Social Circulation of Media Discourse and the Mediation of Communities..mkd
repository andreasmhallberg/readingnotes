- "because of their extensive accessibility and scope, mass media can serve as both reservoirs and reference point for the circulation of words, phrases, and discourse styles in popular culture.´´ 96

- Massmedia är lingvistisk samlingspunkt i stora samhällen: "in large scale societies, a high frequency of interaction and density of communication do occur in a vertical sense -- that is, the typical (or idealized) directionality of face-to-face communication. Thus people have frequent interactions or \7{frequent acts of consumption} with certain media forms, even if they do not directly interact with other users of the same media. Similarly, there is a density of communication in the sense that there is \7{large-scale exposure} to a common communication form, such as simultaneous listening to radio drama or newscast. And finally, as suggested earlier, questions of concerning the production of shared linguistic knowledge, while greatly vexed, can be productively reworked to include analysis of how certain institutions provide \7{common linguistic reference points}." 97 Går mot majoriteten av lngusiter (Routledge companion s. 142) KOLLA CITATET!
