- Reading measures from reading one page of text with four different instructions: 4
  - Normal reading
  - Thorough reading
  - Skimming
  - Spell checking

- Long list of hypothesis different measures. 4--5

- Method. 6
  - 64 participants
  - Remote 120Hz tracker
  - Stimulus
    - 4 texts from Inter nations Reading Speed Texts
    - Each text 146 words, 16 lines
    - Text/instructions in Latin square.
    - Group sessions 1--5

- Statistics on
  - Comprehension scores
  - Fixation duration
  - Saccade amplitude
  - Firs fixation duration/first pass reading time/total reading time ~ word frequency\*relative position in text
  - Firs fixation duration/first pass reading time/total reading time ~ word length\*relative position in text
  - Total reading time by instruction and relative position in text

- Conclusions:
  - Replicates results from research on single lines.
  - Thorough reading similar to normal reading with more re-reading of larger sections (i.e. not regressions on same line.) 16
  - In normal an thorough reading speeds up later in text since context is established.
  - Skimming: 17
    - no change in measures in different parts of text (doesn't speed up). "meaning never becomes adequately constructed"
    - lesser rereading
    - quicker
    - lower comprehension
