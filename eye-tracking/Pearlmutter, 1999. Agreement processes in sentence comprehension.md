# Pearlmutter, Neal J., Susan M. Garnsey, and Kathryn Bock. “Agreement Processes in Sentence Comprehension.” Journal of Memory and Language 41, no. 3 (1999): 427–56.

Three experiments (self-paced reading, eye-tracking, production) on ungrammatical and seemingly ungrammatical verb agreement in English.

- Example stilulus: 432
  1. The key to the cabinet was ...
  2. The key to the cabinet were ... [seemingly incorrect]
  3. The key to the cabinets was ... [seemingly incorrect]
  4. The key to the cabinets were ...

- Subject verb agreement in English: 428
  - largely redundant due to word order
  - only in third person present tense
  - [Makes this similar to Arabic case:] 

  > Quite often then, in English computation, the information necessary to use agreement constants will be unavailable to the comprehended, and, even when it is available, the information provided will often be entirely redundant. Thus the comprehension system might be more efficient if it largely ignored agreement information, backtracking to handle it only when other constraints were insufficient.

- Excludes trials with incorrect answers to comprehension questions. 432

- Excludes participants (2) with less then 90% correct on comprehension questions. 

- Experiment 1: self paced reading
  - Sensitivity to seemingly incorrect agreement appeared directly on the verb. 435
  - Sensitivity to incorrect agreement appeared one word later. 435

- Experiment 2: eye-tracking
  - No effect of anomaly on first pass reading times on verb, verb+1, verb and verb+1 (verb region) combined. 438
  - Readers may react to anomalies by either regress or fixate longer. Filters out fixations that are followed by regression. Then finds significant effect.
  - Effect on total reading time on verb region. 440
  - Probability of regression (first pass and total) significantly higher in verb region for agreement violation. (5 vs. 28%)
  - Regressions are to closest noun, not to offending noun, but only later finds its way there.

- Sensitivity to number agreement even though superfluous. Processing of agreement regardless of relevance to understanding.: 451

  > Because the agreement system of English is comparatively meager and rarely constrains the interpretation of sentences, this early sensitivity argues for a system that continuously integrates grammatical features during comprehension, irrespective of their eventual relevance to understanding.
