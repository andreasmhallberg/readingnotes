# Irmen, L., & Schumann, E. (2011). Processing grammatical gender of role nouns: Further evidence from eye movements. Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 23(8), 998–1014.

-  Investigates effects of grammatical gender in role nouns (Sänger(in)) in establishing coreference in reading. 1000

- Method 
  - Stimulus
    - Sentnecens such as

      > My <kinship term> is a <role noun> <preposition phrase>.

      > My sister is a singer in a band.

      with kinship terms and role nouns masculine or feminine. 1000
    - Role nouns controlled for typically male, female and neutral. 
    - 2x2x3 design
- fixationns below 70 and above 600 ms excluded
- 24 participants
- Measures (reported on on kinship, role noun, spillover regions) 
  - gaze duration
  - total reading time
  - regression path duration
  - regressions out
  - regressions in

- Results
  - first pass reading times (gaze duration)
    - longer on masc. kinship-fem. role. 1002
    - longer on typcially male role that is grammatically fem.
  - regression path duration and total reading time
    - only effect of typicality, not not on grammatical congruency [!]
  - regression in/out
    - not terribly interesting

- Experiment rerun with syntactically anomalous sentences (male kinship-female role), and grammatical anomalies in fillers removed to see if participants were triggered to look for errors.
  - No such effect found. 1012

- Discussion
  - Both real-world knowledge (gender typicality) and linguistic features affect processing directly. 1012
  - Support for standard description of German grammar with masculine form being gender ambiguous.
