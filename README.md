# README

**Important:**

1. **Only some of these notes are complete summaries of the respective reference. Most only contain notes on what I found interesting in the particular reference or of information that is of particular interest to me.**
3. **The headers with the complete bibliographical reference have yet to be properly formatted. Many still have Swedish formatting and no italics.** 


## General description

These are my research related reading-notes on books and articles relating to Arabic Linguistics. I continuously add to and edit these notes as I read and re-read things. I have placed them here primarily as a backup and to make them accessible on different devices. I also want to make these notes accessible to colleges and students, although I am not sure how useful they might be.

Most of the notes were written as part of the research for my dissertation, [*Case Endings in Spoken Standard Arabic*](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/8524489) and there is a heavy emphasis on Standard Arabic, diglossia, and speech.

Not all of these notes are complete summaries and they should not be read as such. I typically only note things that are of interest to what I am doing, meaning that some notes only record a specific detail of a paper or book.

For bibtex references, see the file `bibliotek.bib` in the `mylatexstuff` repo. This is my general bibtex database where I dump all references without any particular order.

## Structure and format

Each file contains notes from one single reference. They are formatted in markdown (a plain text format similar to .txt). As such they can be easily converted via Pandoc or similar to other formats, such as HTML (which is how they are displayed on the GitHub page), .doc, .pdf, or whatever. 

### File name

File names have the following form:

```
<author last name>, <year>. <title>.md
```

For example:

> Ferguson, 1959. Diglossia.mkd

If there are several authors, the file name only contains the first author, without "et\ al.".  

Subtitles are separated from main title with ` - ` rather than `: `. 

### Header

Each file begins with the complete biographical reference in Chicago author-date format as header (i.e. marked with initial `#` in markdown). No other header levels are used. In some notes the header is followed by some general information or comments about the reference.

### Contents

The actual notes referencing the content of the article or book are organized as lists. At the end of each listed note there is a page reference. When the original wording is important (and also when I have been lazy) it is quoted rather then summarized. Longish quotes are in block quotes (marked in markdown with initial `>`) nested (with indentation) under a list item with a very brief summary of the quote. This summary of the quote is intended to make the content quickly skimmable.

Material in square brackets are my comments.

When lists and tables are quoted they are converted to markdown. 

### Keywords

At the end of each file one or more keywords are listed. Each keyword begins with `@` and is on a new line. See `keywords.mkd` for a list of keywords. These keywords are added by me and are not those of the original author.
