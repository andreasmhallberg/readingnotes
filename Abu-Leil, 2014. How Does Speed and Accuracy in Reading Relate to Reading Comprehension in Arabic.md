# Abu-Leil, Aula Khateeb, David L. Share, and Raphiq Ibrahim. 2014. “How Does Speed and Accuracy in Reading Relate to Reading Comprehension in Arabic?” Psicológica: International Journal of Methodology and Experimental Psychology 35 (2): 251–76.

- Investigates. 252
  - whether accuracy and speed in isolated word reading correlates with reading comprehension as it does in English.
  - if diacritization affects reading comprehension

- [Example of terminological mixing of morphemes and graphemses]: 254

  > Usually these are considered as short vowels, but become lengthened by the addition of the long vowels ( A, O, E)
 which are considered part of the set of consonants (ي, و, ا).

- "the complexity of Arabic orthography slows the word identification process." [Highly questionable. In the cited studies compare readers of Arabic with readers of other languages. Difference is assuemded to be caused by script/writing systems/orthography. Might just as well be because of general lower reading skills amongs Arabic speakers.] 254 
- Method
  - isolated words. 261
    - pseudowords, pointed words, unpointed words. Unpointed words are a "different words" from those in the list of pointed words. [i.e. items are not balanced between conditions. Any differences can thus be the result of difference in difficulties in words.] 
    - Lists with different conditions presented in same order to all participants [!]. 262
    - Correct readings counted. [What does this mean? *mḥammad*, *aḍ-ḍuhr*, *al-masa* are correct?]
  - paragraphs
    - [In paragraph reading the four texts are not balanced between condition.]
    > Reading comprehension was asses with four texts (two pointed and two unpointed)

- Results:  264
  - Word reading time: pseudowords slowest, then pointed, then unpointed
  - Word reading accuracy: pseudo words lowest score, then pointed, then unpointed
  - [uninterpretable due to problems with method]
  - Correlation between reading comprehension and reading accuracy and reading speed of isolated words.
