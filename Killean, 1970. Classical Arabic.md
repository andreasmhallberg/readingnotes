- "Modern works in Classical Arabic about Classical Arabic written by Arabs continue the traditional normative or prescriptive outlook of the earlier Arab Grammarians." 423

- List of articles on how to stop language change (borrowings etc.). 423

- Stagnation in Arab linguistics: 424

    > Unfortunately, article on linguistic analysis of Classical Arabic are frequently nothing more than collations of earlier views of Arab authors with very little, if any original thinking. The studies are characterized by general disregard of Western works on similar subjects and a lack of bibliographical references.
