- Diglossia is blamed for poverty, illiteracy, etc. 90

- Leaders maintain the idea of a language crisis and that citizens do not have access to MSA and cannot participate. 93 "What Egyptians are taught to believe about their knowledge and access of SA is not true." 97

- "in spite of all their political conflicts, most Egyptians agree on the linguistic indexes of SA. Access to SA is a prerequisite to legitimacy and political weight." 106

- SA indexes legitimacy: 109
    > SA remains the obvious symbol of political legitimacy. Claiming to master SA and judging the  way others use SA positions individuals in the role of the powerful and sincere Egyptians.

- Example: critique of the language used by judge in the court case against Mubarak. 109
