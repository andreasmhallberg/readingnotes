# Hachimi, A., 2013. The Maghreb-Mashreq language ideology and the politics of identity  in a globalized Arab world. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 17(3), ss.269â€“296.

- Material: YouTube montage from Star Academy and commentaries on YouTube.

- Ideology: 270
  1. "Maghreb speakers bear the 'communicative burden'"
  2. "Maghreb varieties are objects of mockery"
  3. "Mashreq varieties are objects of adulation"

- "stances that have emerged to communicate the 'deficiency' rather than merely the difference of North African Arabic varieties." 271

- Reasons for this attitude/ideology:
  1. Arabic historically form Mashreq. 274
  2. Davide reinforced by French colonial policies.
  3. Mashreq dominant in popular culture. Maghreb exposed to Mashreq but not vice versa. 275

- Maghrebi speakers aligner themselves with Mashreq domination. 284
