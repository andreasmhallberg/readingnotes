- Rinkebysvenska identifies speakers as members of social group. Similar in social function to Black English. 131

- Situation such that creel may develop. 132
  - Limited contact with native speakers
  - Diverse linguistic backgrounds with majority language as lingua franca.

- Language in Rinkeby similar to other pidgins: 132
  - limited vocabulary
  - omission of certain function words
  - reduction of number of prepositions
  - almost complete absence of inflectional endings
  - deviations in word order
  - inter-speaker variation
  - preference of analytic construction, often new ones
  - tense expressed by temporal adverbs

- Pidgins may develop in two directions: realization or convergence with majority language. 134
  - also with individuals 

- unlikely that creel will develop in Sweden. 135
  - mass-media
  - education
  - migration within the country


- Characteristics of rinkebysvenska: 136
  - simplification in grammar, elaboration in lexicon 
  - reduced distinction in vowel quantity and quality
  - deviation in word order, gender agreement and word order
  - similar regardless of mother tongue. Almost impossible to hear mother tongue of speakers
  - used only by young people

- Long term effects on Swedish hard to predict.
