# Sharkawi, Muhammad al-. 2016. ‘The Ecology of Case in Modern Standard Arabic’. Folia Orientalia LIII: 223–59.

Discusses the retention of case in Modern Standard Arabic despite it not having functional load. Traces it to its central position in grammar writing.

- In Sibawayh ther is indication that the case marking is regarded as free variation (ref to Owens 1998).

- "the case system is given a status in the theoretical grammatical works that is different from its use in real linguistic performance" 232

- Modern Arabic grammars (specialized and pedagogical) follow the pattern of classical grammars 232-46
   - focus on use of case. The purpose of grammar seems to be to explain use of case markers.
   - grammars are organized by case, not by function. (e.g. *anna* next to absolute negation)
   - Several summaries of grammatical works

- Examples of inconsistent and incorrect use of case markers in writing and speech. [Uses "recitation" as sysnonym to read speech.] 247-57
