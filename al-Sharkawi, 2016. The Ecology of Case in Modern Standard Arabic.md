# al-Sharkawi, Muhammad. 2016. "The Ecology of Case in Modern Standard Arabic." Folia Orientalia LIII: 223â€“59.

Discusses the retention of case in Modern Standard Arabic despite it not having functional load. Traces it to its central position in grammar writing.

- In Sibawayh there is indication that the case marking is regarded as free variation (ref to Owens 1998).

- "the case system is given a status in the theoretical grammatical works that is different from its use in real linguistic performance" 232


- Modern Arabic grammars (specialized and pedagogical) follow the pattern of classical grammars 232-46
   - focus on use of case. The purpose of grammar seems to be to explain use of case markers.
   - grammars are organized by case, not by function. (e.g. *anna* next to absolute negation)
   - Several summaries of grammatical works

- Different degrees of marking case with vowel signs, "not a trend" and primarily found in bokks in Arabic-related fields such as literature, grammar, or traditional rhetorical studies." 249
  - Example of grammar book where final vowels are marked on nouns and on verbs in the imperative but nowhere else.



- Examples of inconsistent and incorrect use of case markers in writing and speech. [Uses "recitation" as sysnonym to read speech.] 247-57
