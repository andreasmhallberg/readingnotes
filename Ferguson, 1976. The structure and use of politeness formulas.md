# Ferguson, Charles A. 1976. ‘The Structure and Use of Politeness Formulas’. Language in Society 5 (2): 137–51.

- ”little snippets of ritual used in everyday encounters between people” 137

- Importance of politeness formulas are made clear when they are omitted. 140

- Fixed forms. For "good mooring" the adjective must be good. With "happy birthday" the adjective must be happy. 141
  - *mīt marḥaba* but not 200 or 1000 *marḥaba* 144

- Even the use of "good morning" is complicated: 142
  - only used before noon or midday meal
  - only used on first encounter
  - some degree of formality (e.g. not used between students)

- Competent user apply these rules "without conscious rule-application" and can normally not relate these rules. Example with *good morning*: 142

> The appropriate time of day for good morning varies regionally (although not as much as for good evening which differs sharply in different parts of the United States) but generally is between waking up in the morning and the midday meal. It is said only on the first encounter of two people in the morning and is not repeated at subsequent encounters (as *hi* or *hello* can be, sometimes with the addition of again or a comment). Its use implies a certain degree of formality in the occasion, and hence it is not normally appropriate for two university students seeing each other for the first time that morning, walking from one class to another.

- *naʿīman* used for situations related to the public bath. 142

- Response to *sabāḥ al-xēr* with flowers of various kinds (*full, ward, yāsmīn*) 144

- Diachronic characteristics 
  - Weakening and erosion - non-referential, "important for presence or absence rather than for the exact meaning carried by their constituent parts" (like title and assertive particles). 147
  - Include archaic forms, "proverbs, riddles, and nursery rhymes" 148
