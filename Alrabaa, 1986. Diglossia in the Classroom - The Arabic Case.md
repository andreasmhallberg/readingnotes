# Alrabaa, S., 1986. Diglossia in the Classroom: The Arabic Case.  Anthropological Linguistics, 28(1), ss.73-79.

- Research question: is diglossia a cause of analphabetism and low literacy rates in the Arab worlds? 73

- Learning a foreign language as if it is your own leads to imitation and focus on form rather than contents. 74

- "memorizing form is an integral part of learning even at the university level". 74

- Social definition of literacy (correct grammar and spelling) not according to actual competences, according to test reported in article. 76

- Little exposure to MSA in every-day live. Will always be felt as foreign. 77

- Educational practices lead to linguistic insecurity: 78

    > The imposition by the society of a usage which, by nature, is delimited in scope, and more reflective of historical fiction than contemporary linguistic reality can have inhibiting influence on the learner, making him feel insecure in the domains for the free expression in which this alien form is the one to use.
