# Altoma, S.J., 1974. Language Education in Arab Countries and the Role of the Academies.  I J. A. Fishman, red. Advancs in Language Planning. The Hague: Mouton, ss 279â€“313.

- MSA is not used consistently in teaching - students don't reach proficiency aims. 281

- Teaching material centrally planned. This hinders new pedagogical ideas from developing and established traditional teaching methods. 292-

- Arab countries in different stages of Arabization. North Africa slow.

- The attempt at grammatical reform  ''has been constantly rejected primarily for extra-linguistic factors: political, religious, and cultural.'' 282

- Three trend in discussions on grammar teaching, ordered by relative dominance: 296
  1. classicism/conservatism. Argues that increasing literacy leads to wider use of MSA. Builds on faulty assumptions: 282
     1. introduction  MSA words in the dialect does not change its grammatical stucture. 
     2. Uncientific to call dialects corrupt. (Taha Hyssayn). 
     3. Contradicted by actual trend of dialect being used for practical reasons in education and aesthetic reasons in literature.
  2. Simplification of grammar teaching. Simplification of terminology, better arrangement of material in grammar book, better pedagogy, etc. Egyptian academy.
  3. Change grammatical rules/radical reform.
     1. Anis. Egyptian educated Arabic as pan-Arabic standard. 281
     2. Al-Khuli. Simplification of the case system and other morphology. Eg. no diptot, one dual ending, one m.pl. ending, fem.pl. with three different case endings, keep vowel in jussive. 295
     3. Furayha. Supradialectal ESA ("Cultivated Spoken Arabic") as standard. [Desscribed in Kay 1994:49 as MSA without case endigns.] Not politically feasible and Furayha therefore focused on simplification of grammatical description. 296

- Academies, Syrian, Egyptian, Iraqi. Publishes lists of new terms. Too slow, sidelined by individual initiates. Unorganized. Lack of coordination between academies and between academies and state institutions. 304

- Lixace ordered by rood are difficult to use. Growing awareness about advantages of alphabetical ordering. 305
