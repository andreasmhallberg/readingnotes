- Functions of writing: 11-
  1. mnemonic
  2. distancing (communication across distance)
  3. reifying (language not in ephemeral speech)
  4. social control (laws, administration, etc.)
  5. interactional (coordinate action)
  6. aesthetic (litterateur, calligraphy)

 - Evolution of writing systems,
   1. sign sigifies object
   2. sign signifies word (linguistic sign) signifying object
   3. sign used for objects signified by similar words

- Terminology 38
  - *Writing system:* what linguistic units are represented by sign (words, morphemes, syllables, phonemes)
  - *Script:* inventory of graphical signs 
  - *Orthography:* combinatory rules for graphemes in script

  Scrips embody characteristics of more than one writing system. 49 

- Certain writing systems better suited for certain languages. 41
  - syllabic for Japanese (simple syllable structure) 
  - alphabetic for German (complex syllables structure)

- When societies adopt writing this is done by adopting alphabet of neighbors and their language to use for writing. Only later does the writing start to be employed for own language.

- Qualities of writing systems 44
  - *economy:* few signs
  - *simplicity:* relation between sign and sound/word/morpheme/syllable is straight forward
  - *Unequivocally:* meaning of written sign is unambiguously determined by its form

  Relative qualities, increase in one decreases other.

- Written signs refer to abstract enteties. Works because readers already know language and can make inferences/exclusions. 47

- Types of writing systems: 49
  - *pleremic:* encodes meaning (morpheme/word)
  - *cenemic:* encodes sound (syllable/phoneme)

- Good script/writing system for learner not necessarily good for skilled readers. E.g. fewer signs easier to learn but less efficient reading. 53
