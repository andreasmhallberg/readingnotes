# Coulmas, Florian. 1989. The Writing Systems of the World. The Language Library. Oxford, UKâ€¯; New York, NY, USA: B. Blackwell.

- Functions of writing: 11-
  1. mnemonic
  2. distancing (communication across distance)
  3. reifying (language not in ephemeral speech)
  4. social control (laws, administration, etc.)
  5. interactional (coordinate action)
  6. aesthetic (litterateur, calligraphy)

 - Evolution of writing systems,
   1. sign sigifies object
   2. sign signifies word (linguistic sign) signifying object
   3. sign used for objects signified by similar words

- Terminology 38
  - *Writing system:* what linguistic units are represented by sign (words, morphemes, syllables, phonemes)
  - *Script:* inventory of graphical signs 
  - *Orthography:* combinatory rules for graphemes in script

  Scrips embody characteristics of more than one writing system. 49 

- Certain writing systems better suited for certain languages. 41
  - syllabic for Japanese (simple syllable structure) 
  - alphabetic for German (complex syllables structure)

- When societies adopt writing this is done by adopting alphabet of neighbors and their language to use for writing. Only later does the writing start to be employed for own language.

- Qualities of writing systems 44
  - *economy:* few signs
  - *simplicity:* relation between sign and sound/word/morpheme/syllable is straight forward
  - *Unequivocally:* meaning of written sign is unambiguously determined by its form

  Relative qualities, increase in one decreases other.

- Written signs refer to abstract enteties. Works because readers already know language and can make inferences/exclusions. 47

- Types of writing systems: 49
  - *pleremic:* encodes meaning (morpheme/word)
  - *cenemic:* encodes sound (syllable/phoneme)

- Good script/writing system for learner not necessarily good for skilled readers. E.g. fewer signs easier to learn but less efficient reading. 53

## Hieroglyphs

- Mix of logographs, rebuses, and cenemic signs. 61
- signs can be both pleremic (logographs) and cenemic (parts of rebuses). 63
- Determiners --- signs used to disambiguate rebuses. Indicate semantic field.
- Rebuses and phonograms only refer to consonants. 67
- More cursive forms developed for everyday use. Fully developed by 1500 BC. 69
- Remained i in use for thousands of years despite being difficult due to elitist exclusivism. 70
- Latest attested use 200 c.e.

## Cunform
- first Sumerian 
- pictograms
- stylized due to writing on clays
- rectangle tablest made scribes rotate them. Signs were rotated 90 degrees and lost their iconacity. 74
- Adapted to Akkadian 82-
  - added syllable signs
  - added markers for verb suffixes
- Sign inventory reduced to 100 when adapted to Elamite. 84
- Old Persian
  - Under Darius used for administration
  - reduced to 40 sings. Almost alphabetic but signs had both phonetic and syllabic uses.
- One script used for several different writing systems. 88


## Korean hangul 120
- systematic syllabic script constructed 1446.
- Sign consist of consonant and vowel part.
- Replaces convoluted adaption of Chinese script.
- Used in conjunction with Chinese letters in South Korea. Used exclusively in North.

## Japanese
- Large influx of Chinese words through writing (no land border) 124-
  - Can be pronounced both in Japanese and in Sino-Japanese (Chinese with Japanese phonology). One sign can have several Sino-Japanese pronunciations from different periods of borrowing. Certain readings more appropriate in certain contexts.
  - Katakana/haragana: isomorphic syllabic scripts. 132
    - Katakana used for
      - Non-Chinese loanwords
      - onomatopetics
      - emphasis
      - sometimes as endings to kanji.
- 50% of Japanese vocab is Chinese loans. 133

## Semitic
- Phonecian first phonetic script (no logographs or determiners). 139
- Script tree: North Semitic [Phonecian [Greek] Canannite Aramaic [Syriac] [Hebre] [Nabatean [Arabic]]] 142
- Aramaic *lingua franca* in Middel Eeast with late Assyrians (1000--600 BC)
  - Administrative language in Persia
- North Semitic lost short ending vowels. 146-
  - *abija* -> *abij*
  - Waw and yaa comes to designate long vowels at end of words
  - Later used also word internally
- Old Ethiopic [Geez] 153
  - vowel diacritic fuzed with letters to create systematic syllabic script

## The alphabet
- Greek adaption of Phoenician to indicate phonemes and to indicate vowels systematically. Semitic alphabet + vowel letters. First alphabet. 162

 > Systematic vowel indication by signs as the same type as the consonant letters was the real achievement of the Greeks. It made the alphabet more efficient not only for the representation of one language, but also for the transfer to other languages. 

- Semitic heritage shows in alphabetic script in that vowel sounds are almost always under represented. Vowel phonemes almost always outnumber vowel letters. 167
- Alphabetic principle of one-to-one phoneme-letter relation distorted by orthographies: 170-
  - Etymological spelling (*breakfast*)
  - Paradigmatic similarity (Ge. *Tag/Tage*)
  - Word representation (sandhi effects not represented)
  - Homograph avoidance (*blue/blew*)
  - Loan word identification
- Orthographies complicate matters: 175

  > The alphabet is simple, but many alphabetic orthographies are not.

## Orthographic reforms
- Philosophical stances in discussions on social norms: 241-
  - *norm-positivistic:* more important that there is a norm than that there is a good norm
  - *rationale-normative:* norms should be  motivated
  - *conservative*
  - *anarchistic:* norms inhibit individual development
- Breaks with tradition almost never accepted: 252

  > a spelling reform that with a tradition, without putting another one in its place, has practically no chance of being accepted, at least not in a highly literate society.

- Webster's spelling reform 1789. 252-
  - Succeeded because of nationalistic atmosphere in War of Independence. Wanted to differentiate from English.
  - Virtually all spellings that distinguish American spelling from Webster.
    - *centre -> centre*
    - *-ise -> ize*
- Unlike pronunciation, there is no gradual change in spelling. 257
- Little incentives:

  > for the generation that has to enact the reform it implies more inconvenience than relief.

- Spelling "constitute the most obvious part of language to which loyalty can be tied." 260

## Programmatic on writing system studies in linguistics 267-
- all linguistics is based on a written representation of language and has historically only payed lip-service to the prominence of speech.
- writing is an expression of language, although governed by other mechanisms than speech, and should therefore be studied by linguists.
