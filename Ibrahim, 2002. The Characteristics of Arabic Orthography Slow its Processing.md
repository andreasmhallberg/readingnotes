- Summary of research indicating that reading Arabic is slower than European languages. 322

- Experiment 1: 10th graders connect scattered letters in serial order. Hebrew and Arabic. Test speed. Three versions of Arabic, 10 participants in each: 324
  1. unconnected
  2. connected form but isolated on page
  3. mix of the two


    - "The results of the letters-only tests supports the hypothesis that the visual complexity of Arabic letters result in an increased processing load, thus slowing performances in Arabic in comparison with performances of the same task in Hebrew." 325 


- Experiment 2: As above but for Arabic (Latin) numbers, Hindi numbers, and mixed. 325
  - Mixed version slower.
