# Raphiq Ibrahim, Z.E., 2002. The Characteristics of Arabic Orthography Slow its Processing. Neuropsychology, 16(3), s.322â€“6.

[Sets up conditions that disfavor Arabic as compared to Hebrew (isolated letters in connected form) and draws conclusion that Arabic is more difficult to read.]

- Summary of research indicating that reading Arabic is slower than European languages. 322

- Experiment 1: 10th graders connect scattered letters in serial order. Hebrew and Arabic. Test speed. Three versions of Arabic, 10 participants in each: 324
  1. unconnected
  2. connected form but isolated on page
  3. mix of the two

  - [Connected and mixed forms are irrelevant. Shows letters in forms they never actually appear. Compare connected cursive Latin 'e' connected but written in isolation.]

  - [Only middle bars in Figure 1 are relevant. Very small difference, averaged over 10 participants. Star indicating significance but does not correspond to text. No p-value given for this comparison.]

    - "The results of the letters-only tests supports the hypothesis that the visual complexity of Arabic letters result in an increased processing load, thus slowing performances in Arabic in comparison with performances of the same task in Hebrew." 325 [Setup highly biased/unnatural for Arabic.] 

- Experiment 2: As above but for Arabic (Latin) numbers, Hindi numbers, and mixed. 325
  - Mixed version slower.

- [Confused conclusion in how number processing relates to reading.] 326
