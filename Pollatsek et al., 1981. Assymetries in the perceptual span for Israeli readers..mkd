# Pollatsek, A. m.fl., 1981. Asymmetries in the perceptual span for Israeli readers. Brain and Language, 14(1), ss174â€“180.

- ``the direction of reading (and not hemispheric specialization) primarily determines the symmetry of the perceptual span.'' 178

- ``However, it is clear that Hebrew readers are reading their native languages more slowly in terms of surface measures such as words per minute. Inasmuch as more information is condensed in less space in Hebrew because of the greeters use of clinics and because of the omission of many voiles, it is not surprising that the average decade length found for the readers if Hebrew [\ldots] is smaller than the average saccade length (7--9 characters) typically found for readers of English'' 179 

- ``Our results suggest that languages can be characterized by their density (in terms of such measures as the ratio of morphemes to graphemes or syllables to graphemes) and as density increases, subjects will shorten their saccades and lengthen their fixations.'' 179
