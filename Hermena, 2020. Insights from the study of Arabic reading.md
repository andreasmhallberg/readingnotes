- Word identification

  - fMRI evidence that non-diacritized words are retrieved directly by lexical memory and that diacritized words are phonologically computed. 7

  - Eye-tracking evidence that "if the upcoming word lack diacritics, its pronunciation corresponds to the most frequent one in print."
    - [see diacritization practices]

  - Diacritized words are read ore slowly, but no effect in fully diacritized text. 8

  - Arabic reading less dependent on phonemic decoding than Latinate orthographies. [i.e. more direct route] 8

  - Transposition of letter negates benefit of parafoveal preview and primes, as opposed to Latinate orthographies. 8   
    - "rigid letter-position coding"
    - bilingual readers switch between rigid and flexible letter-position encoding for languages.

- Morphological processing

  - Processing of word root  elicit different brain activity than processing of word pattern. Separate cognitive processes. 9

  - Words are "automatically and obligatorily" decomposed for root. 10

- Eye movements

  - Reading speed slower for Arabic than English for WPM, but equal for information content (Arabic is denser.) 13 

  - Skipping rate of 8% for Arabic, as compared to 30% for English. 13

- Learning to read Arabic

  - Letter identification for beginner readers relatively slow in Arabic. 13

  - Problems with reading throughout primary education. Slower to learn to read. 14
