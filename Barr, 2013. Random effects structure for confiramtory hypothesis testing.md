- Don't use only random intercepts: 257

  > For designs including within-subjects (or within-items) manipulations, random-intercepts only LMEMs can have catastrophically Type 1 error rates

- Researchers must understand how effects are assumed to co-vary for conditions/items/participants. 258

- Structures and correlations in the data that are not of theoretical interest are *random effects* to be compensated for in the model. 259

- Maximalist effects structure is preferred, including: 260
  - intercept for participant - some are generally slower
  - intercept for items - some items give generally slower results
  - slope for participants - some participants are generally more sensitive to the manipulation
  - participant intercept and slope correlate - participants that read quicker (lower intercept) may be less attentive and thus be less sensitive to manipulation (lower slope).

- lm syntax for maximal effect structure in typical experiment : `Y ~ X + (1 + X|Subject) +(1|Item)` 268

- If model does not converge (cannot find best fit) remove: 161-
  1. drop correlation: `Y ~ X + (1|Subject) +(0 + X|Subject) +(1|Item)` 
  2. drop subject intercept but keep slope `Y ~ X +(0 + X|Subject) +(1|Item)`
