# Ibrahim, Muhammad H., 1983. Linguistic Distance and Literacy in Arabic. Journal of Pragmatics 7:507-515

Discusses negative effects of diglossia on literacy. 507

- Learning how to read in Arabic is both new language *and* graphical representation. 508

- Diglossia is a continuum (El-Hassan 1977) for the highly educated, but for not highly educated it is a dichotomy [i.e. Ferguson's classical diglossia]. 509

- Icraab: "teaching/learning Arabic is often equated with teaching/learning grammar, which in turn is equated with teaching/learning the system of grammatical inflection." 512

- "spoken Arabic is considered to be unworthy of the label 'language' but rather a nameless verbal corruption." 512 The study of spoken Arabic is suspect. 513

- Extremely rare to hear someone read without interference from spoken language. 512 

- Policy makers are either unaware of the effects of diglossia on literacy or are afraid to talk about it. 513

- Diglossia originates in strong ideology of unchanging language. 513

- Conclusion: see SA as second language, research about differences, and develop pedagogy accordingly. 514
