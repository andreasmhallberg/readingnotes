Discusses negative effects of diglossia on literacy. 507

- Learning how to read in Arabic is to learn both a new language *and* a graphical representation. 508

- Diglossia is a continuum (El-Hassan 1977) for the highly educated, but for not highly educated it is a dichotomy [i.e. Ferguson's classical diglossia]. 509

- Arabs have difficulties in learning case/mood inflection: 511

  > the vastly simplified inflectional system of spoken Arabic means that learners of the standard language will and do have considerable difficulty in learning the rich and fairly complicated system of grammatical inflections of written Arabic.

- Grammar equated with *iÊ¿raab*: 512

  > teaching/learning Arabic is often equated with teaching/learning grammar, which in turn is equated with teaching/learning the system of grammatical inflection.

- "spoken Arabic is considered to be unworthy of the label 'language' but rather a nameless verbal corruption." 512
  - The study of spoken Arabic is suspect. 513

- Extremely rare to hear someone read without interference from spoken language. 512

- Policy makers are either unaware of the effects of diglossia on literacy or are afraid to talk about it. 513

- Diglossia originates in strong ideology of unchanging language. 513

- Conclusion: see SA as second language, research about differences, and develop pedagogy accordingly. 514
