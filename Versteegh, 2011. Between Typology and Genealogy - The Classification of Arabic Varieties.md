# Versteegh, C.H.M., 2011. Between Typology and Genealogy: The Classification of Arabic Varieties. In A. A. Avram, A. Foceneanu, & G. Grigore, eds. A Festschrift for Nadia Anghelescu. Bucarest: Universităţii din Bucureşti, pp. 537–549.

Largely critic of Owens (2006).

- History of linguistic classifications:
  1. Genealogy after the flood story
  2. Era of discoveries - new languages: Babel story
  3. 19th century: languages as biological evolution

- Owens hold that Classical Arabic contains innovations with regard to proto- Semitic (case endings, dual verb endings) that are not there in modern dialects: common features in the dialects represent older features.
