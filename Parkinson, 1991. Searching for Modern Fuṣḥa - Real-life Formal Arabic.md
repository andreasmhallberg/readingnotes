# Parkinson, Dilworth, 1991. Searching for Modern Fuṣḥa: Real-life Formal Arabic. Al-ʿArabiyya 24:31-64.

- Prescriptivism. MSA defined in language in news-media etc. but "people do not accept the notion that usage in these defining media determines the correct form of the language." 32

- "there is also no well accepted concept of Modern Standard Arabic as a distinct variety." 33

- No consensus of Arabic term for MSA. Six examples of different terms 33

- Two opinions:
    1. "for many Egyptians, the term fuṣḥā is limited entirely  to the language of the classical period and to the modern language that mimics it." 34 *fuṣḥā* includes archaisms and classical style. 34
    2. MSA (in news etc.) is good *fuṣḥā*.

- Confusion whether *fuṣḥā* is style or variant.

- Arab linguists give little legitimacy to common usage: 35

    > Similarly, when [in conferances on language] a linguist points out a common usage in newspaper Arabic that is at odds with Classical Arabic, it is common for him/her to be informed that people are simply making a mistake, with the implication that no other explanation is needed, that modern Arabs don't have the "right" to develop their on formal language 

- No differentiation between modern and classical Arabic. E.g. in lexica. 35-36
    - Egyptian Academy "has published a dictionary recently with an absolutely confusing mixture of archaic, classical, and modern meanings under almost every entry." 36

- On levels: data is extremely confusing. Easy to find exceptions to all proposed definitions. Risks of circular reasoning if features define a level. 37. 

- Four ways of reading SA aloud 38:
    1. prescriptively correct
    2. partly but correct icraab
    3. icraab only on some verbs and before enclitic pronoun. [Same as 2?]
    4. No icraab.

- Ideology of Arab and Islamic unity and heritage informs language teaching: 39 

    > Many overtly state that the purpose of teaching formal Arabic to children in school is not so much to make them literate members of a modern society but to keep them in touch with their classical literary and religious heritage. Thus the emphasis on memorizing long passages of classical Arabic poetry, and the consistent testing of obscure and archaic vocabulary in the national educational exams [in Egypt]. 

- Native 'users,' not 'speakers'. 39.

- As answer to direct question on *fuṣḥā*, answers do not reflect actual behavior. 52

- Three normative views of *fuṣḥā* 53:
    1. Pro-narrow-*fuṣḥā*
    2. Anti-narrow-*fuṣḥā*
    3. Expanded-*fuṣḥā*

- Matched guise test: phonology more important than icraab for impressions of *fuṣḥā*ness. 57

- Broad spectrum of what is accepted as *fuṣḥā*. 58

- Not pronouncing icraab rated as 'smarter'. 59

- "middle’ solution, with partial vowelling but correct (Egyptian) phonology, a clear preference over other styles." 61
