# Parkinson, Dilworth, 1991. Searching for Modern Fuṣḥa: Real-life Formal Arabic. Al-ʿArabiyya 24:31-64.

- Prescriptivism. MSA defined in language in news-media etc. but "people do not accept the notion that usage in these defining media determines the correct form of the language." 32

- "there is also no well accepted concept of Modern Standard Arabic as a distinct variety." 33

- No consensus of Arabic term for MSA. Six examples of different terms 33

- Two opinions:
  1. "for many Egyptians, the term fuṣḥā is limited entirely  to the language of the classical period and to the modern language that mimics it." 34 *fuṣḥā* includes archaisms and classical style. 34
  2. MSA (in news etc.) is good *fuṣḥā*.

- Confusion whether *fuṣḥā* is style or variant.

- Arab linguists give little legitimacy to common usage: 35

  > Similarly, when [in conferances on language] a linguist points out a common usage in newspaper Arabic that is at odds with Classical Arabic, it is common for him/her to be informed that people are simply making a mistake, with the implication that no other explanation is needed, that modern Arabs don't have the "right" to develop their on formal language 

- No differentiation between modern and classical Arabic. E.g. in lexica. 35-36
  - Egyptian Academy "has published a dictionary recently with an absolutely confusing mixture of archaic, classical, and modern meanings under almost every entry." 36

- On levels: data is extremely confusing. Easy to find exceptions to all proposed definitions. Risks of circular reasoning if features define a level. 37. 

- Four ways of reading SA aloud: 38
  1. prescriptively correct
  2. partly but correct *iʿrāb*
  3. *iʿrāb* only on some verbs and before enclitic pronoun. [Same as 2?]
  4. No *iʿrāb*.

  > it is possible to orally perform a written modern fuṣḥa text (1) with full vowelling and fully correct use of pause form (including even such archaisms as changing the *-an* of *giddan* to *-a* before a pause, as is currently done by a single news reader on Egyptian television), (2) with only partial vowelling and some incorrect use of pause form (putting pause forms when there is no pause putting vowels before a pause), and note that there is a wide range of partial vowelling here, from most to only a little with clear hierarchy of contexts where vowels are more likely to be retained, (3) with *iʿraab* vowels only on some verbal forms and before pronouns suffixes and nowhere else, or (4) with no *iʿraab* vowels at all, but with otherwise correct syntax; in each of these cases, most Egyptians would still consider the performance an example of modern fuṣḥa (whatever they happen to call it).   

  - Also with colloquial phonology.

- Ideology of Arab and Islamic unity and heritage informs language teaching: 39 

  > Many overtly state that the purpose of teaching formal Arabic to children in school is not so much to make them literate members of a modern society but to keep them in touch with their classical literary and religious heritage. Thus the emphasis on memorizing long passages of classical Arabic poetry, and the consistent testing of obscure and archaic vocabulary in the national educational exams [in Egypt]. 

- Native 'users,' not 'speakers'. 39

- As answer to direct question on *fuṣḥā*, answers do not reflect actual behavior. 52

- Three normative views of *fuṣḥā*: 53
  1. Pro-narrow-*fuṣḥā*
  2. Anti-narrow-*fuṣḥā*
  3. Expanded-*fuṣḥā*

- Matched guise test with text manipulated for standard/non-standard phonology
  - Phonology more important than *iʿrāb* for impressions of *fuṣḥā*-ness. 57
  - Half of participants accepted all texts as *fuṣḥā*. 58
  - Not pronouncing *iʿrāb* rated as 'smarter'. 59

- case-less Standard Arabic often preferred over Standard Arabic with case: 61

  > there is a wide range of acceptable oral performances of styles of a text whose written form would be accepted as fuṣḥā, and tha that while increasing "authenticity" or "classicizaiont" of phonological variables increase acceptance of the text, completely full vowelling and proper observation of pause forms, and the like, can actually decrease it, making a "middle" solution, with partial volwelling but correct (Egyptiian) phonology, a clear preference over other varieties. This indicates that the grammar vowels are probably not being used much to disambiguate the text, but rather to mark them stylistically.
