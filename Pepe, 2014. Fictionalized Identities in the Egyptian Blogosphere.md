# Pepe, Teresa. 2014. Fictionalized Identities in the Egyptian Blogosphere. Oslo: University of Oslo.

[Notes only on 5.6 "The Language and Style of Egyptian Blogs".]

- Blogs are both private and public discourse, calling for goth *ʿāmmiyya* and *fuṣḥā*. 236

- "young Egyptian bloggers consider it important to write in Arabic" as opposed to English. 237

- *Fuṣḥā* predominates in narrative. 240

- Most bloggers write dialogue in *ʿāmmiyya*, reflecting practices in literature.

- 20 of 40 bloggers write in *ʿāmmiyya* or mix of *ʿāmmiyya* and *fuṣḥā*. 242

- Most write posts entirely in either variety, while some switch. [Switches appear to be fairly clear cut, clearly dilinable sections.]

- Deffest ways of transcribing *ʿāmmiyya*, orthographic variation. 247

- Orthographic and grammatical errors are common. Often concisely left in to signal spontaneity. 248-, 252
  - Retained in some printed versions of blogs. 250

- Choice of variety to signal personality traits/identity. 252
  - *fuṣḥā*

   > contributes literariness and fictionality to the text, ant contributes to the representation of the author as a writer and intellectual

  - *ʿāmmiyya*

  > sets the tone for intimacy, authenticity, honesty, liberal thought, accessibility, pragmatics, closeness to everyday citizens, and a leftist and anti-traditional attitude; often it also has a humanistic effect.

- New mixed written language.
