- Test with Greek cloze test to fill in H and L form in H and L context.

- Small effect of education - knowledge in H is passive. 10

- Diglossia as process: transformation from L to H to various degrees, but no clear goal. 12 No need for levels, rather mechanisms of transformation. 13

  > In the diglossic case, H varieties are derived from L by the process of purification. The process has no definite terminal point; there is no 'pure' H, only an indefinite process of approximations in the direction of a more highly classicalized representation. Consequently, while descriptive grammars can be written for L, grammars of K must be based in prescriptive rules for purification. 14
