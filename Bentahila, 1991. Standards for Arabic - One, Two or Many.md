# Bentahila, A. & Davies, E.E., 1991. Standards for Arabic: One, Two or Many?  Indian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 17(1), ss.69â€“88.

Discusses CA, MSA and ESA as candidates for standard. 

- Ferguson's point on middle ground often misinterpreted: 72

  > On the contrary, it is precisely because of the sharp opposition between Classical and colloquial Arabic, the fact that one cannot be written while the other can hardly be used in spontaneous speech, that other varieties have been found useful to fill in the middle ground. [...] Ferguson qualifies these intermediate varieties as being 'relatively uncodified' and 'unstable'. The fact that scholars do not even agree on how many such varieties are to be identified would seem to endorse this view.

- CA vs MSA: 76

  > However, it [MSA] can be contrasted with the latter [CA] with regard to codification. While the form of Classical Arabic has its unquestionable authority in the Koran, the authorities for Modern Standard Arabic are somewhat less clear.

- Discussion of the failures of the academies. 76-79 

- Case in spoken standard Arabic (in relation to Mitchell (1982:145-6)) 79-80

  > perhaps the only really well established fact of spoken standard Arabic is that it lacks the case and mood endings of MSA and the Classical language as well as the indefinite mark of so-called 'nunation'

- Biggest drawback with the "present situation" is the load it puts on the educational system. 81
