# Albirini, Abdulkafi, Elabbas Benmamoun, and Brahim Chakrani. 2013. “Gender and Number Agreement in the Oral Production of Arabic Heritage Speakers.” *Bilingualism: Language and Cognition* 16 (1): 1–18. doi:10.1017/S1366728912000132.
 
- Aim: 2
    - difference in competence in verbal-agent and subject-noun agreement in heritage speakers.
    - is over-generalization of default form at play?

- L2 learners master verbal agreement before adjective-noun agreement (Alhawary 2002, 2003) 5

- Masculine and singular forms learned first by L1 children (Omar 2007) 5

- Experiments: elicitation via images and narration (Frog Story).

- More likely to produce correct agreement when subject in sentence is human. 8

- Vast majority of errors are ever-generalization of ms forms. 11,12
    - Similar to L1 learners (children) and L2 learners

- Heritage speakers use more verbless clauses than control group. Avoidance strategy from verbs. 11

- Discussion:
    - HS higher accuracy in verbs than in adjectives.
        - despite verbal morphology ore complex
        - may be due to
            - frequency differences 13
            - syntactic centrality of verb, pro-drop licensing
            - higher semantic load 14 

- More accurate in narrative than in elicitation due to avoidance stategies. 14
