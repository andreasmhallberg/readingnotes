# Parkinson, Dilworth, 1990. Orthographic Variation in Modern Standard Arabic: The Case of the Hamza.  Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics II, 269-95

- Variation in spelling of *hamza* similar to variation on other languages (by social and other parameters). Ergo: MSA is a "real" and living language.

- "There is also a tendency to ignore the grammar vowels and keep forms the same across grammatical cases." 286

- Critique of Kaye: Kay makes two claims:  287-290
  1. SA is noones mother-tongue = ill-defined and difficult to learn. Parkinson: "Very few native-speaking English students write coherent English either." 288. 
  2. Dialects are uniform while MSA has "rampant variation". Parkinson: Big variation in dialect. "If a language must be uniform to be well-defined, the no language is well-defined" 289.

- Two paradigms:
  1. SA is not a real language.
  2. SA is defined by grammar books. Deviations are mistakes.

- "The author strongly believes that Standard Arabic is a full-fledged language" 292.

- "Only a few people speak literary English at home [...] but this does not mean no one is a native user of literary English." 292

- MSA must be studied as part of a larger linguistic context. MSA is a part of a language.

- In defense of  MSA:  294

  > We are also missing the boat of we believe that nothing is linguistic interest is going on in Standard Arabic at all since it is an undefinable hybrid form. It is clearly an important an enormously interesting linguistic variety; it is deeply embedded into the social system, and has many of the marks of the 'real', vibrant,  'living', changing variable system that appears to mark all non-artificial languages.
