- Four strategies of dealing with the term *grapheme* identified: 28
  1. rejecting the term
  2. not defining the term
  3. preferring the term *letter*
  4. assuming a definition

- Three criterion for *grapheme*
  1. *Lexical distinctiveness.* Tested with minimal pairs. 35
  2. *Linguistic value.* Often phonological. 36
  3. *Minimality.* is not composed of combinations of other graphemes.

  [Dots on letters are not, since they have no linguistic value.]
