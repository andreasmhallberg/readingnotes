- Middle Arabic differs from modern Modern Arabic [dialects] in: 3
  - its cultural significance in literary texts
  - mixed with Classical Arabic
  - "Middle Arabic must carefully be deduced from texts bristling with Classical and pseudo-correct elements" wheres Modern Arabic is deduced from speech.

- MSA is artificial: 3 (footnote 5)

  > Modern Arabic, being the total of the modern Arabic dialects, must nut be mistaken for the Modern Arabic Literary Language, which is, to some extent, an artificial revival of Classical Arabic.

- After the concuests: "clear dichotomy" between analytical vernaculars and synthetic Classical Arabic. 8

- Levels of Middle Arabic: 25-6
  1. Some kind of Classical Arabic with Middle Arabic admixture.
  2. Semi-Classical Middle Arabic
  3. Some kind of 'clissicized' Middle Arabic.

  - 1. is aimed outside the Jewish community, 2. is withing, 3. for lower strata of Jewish community.

- All texts written by Jews contain elements of Middle Arabic: failed to reach Classical ideal. 27-8
  - hypo-corrections: not sufficiently correct.
  - hyper-correction: changes dialectal form that should not be corrected.
