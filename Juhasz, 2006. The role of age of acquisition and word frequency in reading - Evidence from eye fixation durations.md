# Juhasz, Barbara J., and Keith Rayner. 2006. “The Role of Age of Acquisition and Word Frequency in Reading: Evidence from Eye Fixation Durations.” Visual Cognition 13 (7–8): 846–63. https://doi.org/10.1080/13506280544000075.

Two experiments to disentangle AoA from frequency effects in fixation times
  1. 2x2
  2. semi-factorial (one is kept constant while the other varies)

- AoA effects found in picture naming, word naming, and lexical decision tasks. Effect may not be generalizable to reading. 847

- Results
  - Small frequency effects compared to other studies where AoA is not controlled for: 854
    - first fixation: 10
    - single fixation: 12
    - gaze duration: 17
    - total fixation: 20
    
    Probably means that large chunk of normally observed frequency effect is actually AoA effect.

- AoA and frequency effects can be separated. 859
