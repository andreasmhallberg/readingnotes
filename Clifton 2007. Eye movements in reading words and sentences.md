# Clifton, Charles, Adrian Staub, and Keith Rayner. 2007. “Eye Movements in Reading Words and Sentences.” In Eye Movements: A Window on Mind and Brain, edited by Roger P. G. Van Gompel, John H. Fisher, Wayne S. Murray, and Robin L. Hill, 341–372.

- Eye-tracking on syntactic effects identify critical regions rather than words, using following measures: 348-9
  - first pass reading time - "the sum fixations in region from first entering the region until leaving the region"
  - go past or regression path duration - "the sum of all fixations in a region from first entering the region until moving to the right of the region."
  - regressions-out - "the probability of regressing out of region, generally limited to the first pass reading of that region"
  - second pass reading time - "the sum of all fixations in a region following the initial first pass time, including zero times when a region is not refixated"
  - total reading time - "the sum of all fixations in a region, both forward and recessive movements"
  - first fixation duration - reported when region is small

- "early" and "late" measures (Rayner et al. 1989). 349

- Tables of 100 articles on eye movements in sentence comprehension indicating type of study.

- Syntactic anomalies:
  - Few studies on the effects of syntactic anomalous sentences. 363
  - Of fours studies that have explicitly syntactic anomaly only two found effects on offending word.
  - Unclear how syntactic anomalies effects comprehension: 364

    > In sum, the overall picture both from ERP and eye movement research suggests that the question of exactly when syntactic and semantic anomalies each affect language comprehension is still to be settled. 

- The large variation in sentence comprehension measures (as compared to word identification) may depend on: 366-7
  - task and goal of the reader.
  - variety of strategies to tackle difficult passage (go back, pause, plunge on, etc.)
