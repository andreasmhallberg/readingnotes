# Corriente, Federico C. 1971. “On the Functional Yield of Some Synthetic Devices in Arabic and Semitic Morphology.” The Jewish Quarterly Review 62 (1):20–50.

- Questions the "tradition assumption of a strongly synthetic character of Old (and  Classical) Arabic, apparently based upon the presence therein of some nominal case endings and verbal mood inflections." 20

- Dogmatic view of case endings in AGT: 21

  > were on this issue caught in a mental trap, as they accepted as axiom and dogma that the *Iʿraāb* was not only importat but cunsubstantial in Arabic 

- Case endings not present in silent reading: 29

  > as far as we can judge from our years of experience with Arab students and other educated persons in the course of lectures and reading exercises, no one any longer seems to see, identify, or need the *Iʿrāab*-morphs in order to understand standard texts, in agreement with the analytical structure of today's spoken dialects. It would thus be correct to assume that such signs have no linguistic reality in silent reading (as it happens also in loud reading by less sophisticated and yet literate people), and the few who still are able to use them impeccably, do so only after long and painstaking training

- Quantative investigation of the functional yeald of case markers in ("functionally nececarry cases" in percent) 35--6
  1. Muʿallaqat Imr ul-Qays 10.4%
  2. Quran, sura 12 0%
  3. Abī Rabīʿa's *Dīwān* 3%
  4. *Kalīla wa-Dimna* 1%
  5. Poems of Aḥamd Šawqī 3%
  6. Naguib Mahfouz's *aS-Sukkariyya* 0%

- Case endings functional marginal even in pre-Islamic poetic koiné. 38

- Higher rate of functional load of case endings in poetry of all eras "almost servile imitation of ancient models" 40

- Explanation of the three cases why superfluous: 45
  - Nominative - inital position, verb agreement
  - Accusative - second position, closeness to verb
  - Genitive - preposition and casus rectionis

- Arabic case show oddly little interaction with word stems. 27 "in case of phonetic trouble, the case morph simply vanishes." 48
