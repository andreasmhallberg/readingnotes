Abbreviations:
  - FTA: face-threatening act
  - H: hearer
  - S: speaker

- Face: def 63

> **negative face**: the want of every 'competent adult member' that his actions be unimpeded by others.  
> **positive face**: the want of ever member that his wants be desirable to at least some others

- Types of FTAs 65-
  - threats hearer's'
    - negative face (orders, suggestions, offers, promises)
    - positive face (disapproval, criticism, complaint, mention of taboo, bringing bad news, raising controversial topic)
  - threats speaker's
    - negative face (expressing thanks, excuses, accepting offer)
    - positive face (apologies, accept compliment, confession, physical mishap)
 
- Choice of FTA strategy (seriousness of FTA) 69
  - do FTA
    - on record
      - without redressive action, baldly ("Do X!") (1)
      - with redressive action
        - positive politeness ("Do X, dear.") (2)
        - negative politeness ("Would you mind doing X?") (3)
    - off record ("It's cold in here.") (4)
  - don't do FTA (5)

- Description of merits of FTA strategies.
- Use the minimally serous FTA strategy to minimize ascribed seriousness. 74

- Formula for evaluating seriousness of FTA: 76

  > W_x = D(H,S) + P(H,S) + R_x

  Sum of distance between hearer and speaker, relative power of hearer over speaker, and culturally defined degree of seriousness of action (request, etc.).

  - Linguistic shape of FTA ("Would you mind terribly if...") only show summed seriousness of FAT, not how this sum was reached (large distance, power relation, etc.). 81

- Formulae: 235-

  - Develops naturally as part of face management: 235

  > culturall stabilized interaction rituals with conventionalized formulae are very largely FTA-oriented, and the ritual formulae (which form no small part of members' notions of politeness) for apologies, thanks, farewells, condolencens, sneezes (*God bless you*), stumbles (*whoopsy-daisy*) are evidence of the great utility and face-cost benefit of having ready-made ways of dealing woth potential face-loss situations.

  - formulaic interactions "seem essentially similar to those observable in less ritualized FTA-generated interchanges." 236
  - "balance principle" (A damages B's face. A must repair with face work, B must express acceptance of face work.)
