- Traditional view
  - E.g, Levinson & Brown, Leech
  - Politeness as extralinguistic. 239
  - Main feature: 240
    1. Grician focus
    2. Speech-act focus

- Post-modern view
  - Watts, Ealen, Mills
  - Two main premises
    1. Division between "politeness1" (everyday definitions of politeness, measures attitudes) vs. "politeness2" (theoretical definition). Politeness1 is the focus of study. 240
    1. Reliance on social theory (habitus)
  - Differs from Traditional view: 241
    - politeness not seen as cooperatice act, but power struggle.
    - hearer oriented rather than speaker oriented.
    - discourse view, unit of analysis larger than single act/situation, meanings negotiated by interlocutors over time.
  - Critique:
    - Problem with definition of object of study (politeness1). [throrizing pre-theorized politenss]
    - Emphasize opposed norms/struggle. Opposition/conflict is assumed.
    - Reject predication/generalizations.

- Frame-based view:
  - Data driven, empirical. Politeness defined as recurring patterns of interaction. Avoids analyzer bias.
  - Focus on regularity/recurrence rather then creative generation.
  - A person is polite by choosing an expression they assume the speakers recognizes as polite, which requires regularity. Expressions 258

  >are polite *because* they are regular. It is the regular co-occurrence of particular types of contexts and particular linguistic expressions as unchallenged realizations of particular acts that creates the perception of politeness

  - Politeness of habit: 250

  > politeness is a matter not of rational calculation, but of habit, and frames. 

    - Where no established habit exists for the frame, politeness is more effortful, but essentially the same.
