# Parkinson, D.B., 1981. VSO to SVO in Modern Standard Arabic: A study in diglossia syntax.  Arabiyya, 14(1), ss.24â€“37.

- OSV, VOS frequent. [!] 24

- no *N*

- MSA defined as "the 'high' variety of the diglossia situation" 26
 
- Interprets variation SVO/VSO as difference in "warmth" and/or "emphatic". 29. [Does not consider fore-/backgrounding.]

- List of genres and degree of SVO. Relatively low in all.

- SVO in all headlines: 29

  > Headlines, for some reason, almost entirely SVO [98%]. This is particularly striking since the first sentence of most news articles repeats the headlines exactly except changing it to VSO.
