- Arabic script for African languages commonly, and academically, called *ajami*. 41

- Arabic only supraregional script in Africa except Roman. 41

- Independently developed orthographies. Wide range of variation of degrees and methods of adaptation. Mostly not standardized. 43

- Attested use of Arabic script for 80 languages, not counting varieties of Arabic. (Extensive bibliography.)  44

- Arabic script not recognized due to three biases:
  - Ethnocentric bias
    - Use of Arabic script not recognized as form of writing. Its mere existence sometimes explicitly denied. View reflected in some modern works. 46
    - Use of Arabic script equated with illiteracy. 47
  - Religious bias
    - Marginalized as Islamic literature.
    - Problematic in that border between religious and secular difficult to draw. 48
    - Emphasized also in local traditions valuing religious aspects higher. Secular texts less likely to be preserved.
  - Linguistic bias
    - Arabic seen as unfit to represent non-Semitic languages. But similar problems also with Roman orthography (e.g. lack of indication of tone). Double-standards. 50-

- UN statistics of literacy does not recognize literacy in non-Roman scripts. 54

- Arabic based script may be viable way of increasing literacy: 56
  - High societal acceptance. Not seen as foreign, not even as Islamic. 56

- Madrasa (Arabic) literacy has proved resilient, despite state policy enforcing Roman script. 57
