[Instigates the effect differences between spoken Arabic and Standard Arabic in phonology and syllabic structure on reading acquisition.]

- *Simple view of reading*: reading = decoding X comprehension (Gough et al.). 432
- Consensus on the role of oral language for reading acquisition. 435

- Method
  - Participants: 32 kindergarten and first-graders. Children not able to reproduce phonemes excluded. 437
    - [Tests skills in prescriptive rather than functional Standard Arabic?]
  - Task: phonemic identification and phonetic encoding in pseudo words. 437
    - [CVCC considered Standard Arabic sturcture. Questionable.]. 439

- Results: 443
  - Standard phonemes more difficult to isolate.
  - Standard syllable (CVCC) more difficult to encode.
    - Can be explain by general difficulty of consonant clusters. 445n2

- "results of the study confirm the hypothesis that the linguistic distance between MSA and spoken Arabic interferes with the acquisition of basic reading processes in MSA." 445
