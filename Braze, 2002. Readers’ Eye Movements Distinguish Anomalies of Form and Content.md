# Braze, David, Donald Shankweiler, Weijia Ni, and Laura Conway Palumbo. “Readers’ Eye Movements Distinguish Anomalies of Form and Content.” Journal of Psycholinguistic Research 31, no. 1 (2002): 25–44.

Compares eye-movement patterns in syntactic and pragmatic anomalies. 

# Method

- Stimulus
  - control, syntactic anomaly, pragmatic anomaly (similar to Ni et al. 1998) 29
  - 36 target sentences, 72 fillers. 31 
  - 25% of filler contained anomalies "so that anomalous target items were not conspicuous." 31

- Procedure
  - fixation point at start of sentence used for calibration. 31
  - comprehension questions after 24 targets and 12 fillers.

- Measurements
  - first pass reading times 31
    
    > summed fixation durations within a region, beginning with the first fixation inside the region and ending with, but not including, the first subsequent fixation outside the region.

  - and number of regressions
  - regression landing sites (end of regression chain) 32

- regions (AOIs)
  1. subject
  2. modal verb + adverb
  3. critical verb plus next word
  4. next two words
  5. remainder of sentence (0--4 words)

# Results

- region 3 (target)
  - First pass reading time
    - pragmatic anomaly: longer
    - syntactic anomaly: longer (+36ms)
  - Regressions
    - pragmatic anomaly: no effect
    - syntactic anomaly: dramatic increase (control=.10, syntactic=.48) 
  - Word-by-word analysis: regressions, but not reading times, are inflated directly on syntactically anomalous word. 

- region 4 (2nd and 3d post target word)
  - First pass reading time
    - pragmatic anomaly: longer
    - syntactic anomaly: no effect
  - Regressions
    - pragmatic anomaly: increase
    - syntactic anomaly: increase (smaller control=.11, syntactic=.18)

- region 5 (4th and 5th post target word)
  - First pass reading time: no effects

- End of sentence: sharp increase in regression for pragmatic anomly

# Discussion. 39
  - Reaction to syntactic anomalies immediate but disappear later in sentence.
  - Reaction to pragmatic anomalies not immediate but lingers and peaks at end of sentence, with regressions to anomalous verb.

- [No report on results from comprehension questions.]
