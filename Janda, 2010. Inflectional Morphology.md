# Janda, Laura. 2010. “Inflectional Morphology.” In The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics, edited by Dirk Geeraerts and Hubert Cuyckens, 632–49. 

## What is inflectional morphology?

- "In most languages inflectional morphology marks relations such as" 632
  - person
  - number
  - case
  - gender
  - possession
  - tense
  - aspect
  - mood

- "essential grammatical glue holding the relationships in constructions together"

- Inflectional morphemes are typically: 634

  - Bound: must be attached to a lexical morpheme 
    - "When both derivational and inflectional morphemes are present in a word, the derivational morpheme(s) will generally be attached closer to the root"
    - derivational morphemes relates to the word itself, inflectional morphemes to the construction
    - often difficult to tell where lexeme ends and inflection begins

  - Closed-class
    - extremely resistant to borrowing
    - "by far the smallest class of morphemes in a language"

  - Obligatory: 636
    - applied to new words that enter the language
    - [Orthographically marked case in Arabic is odd:]

  > every (or nearly every) member of a paradigm is instantiated for every (or nearly every) word in a given class. [...] If, for example, a language inflects its nouns for number and case, all nouns will obligatorily express these categories.

  - General
    - across all words in a paradigm
    - across a set of constructions

  - Semantically abstract
    - "The meanings of inflectional categories are notoriously difficult to describe."
    - but are grounded in embodied experiences

  - Inflectional vs. derivational morphemes:

  > Whereas the meaning of derivational morphemes points inward, to the word and what it means, the meaning of inflectional morphemes points away from a word. Inflectional meaning is the meaning that exists between words (the adhesive for the slots), and this fact motivates variation across languages as to whether grammatical meanings are assigned to inflection or to other parts of language.

- "Each language has its own set of obligatory grammatical categories." Different sets of categories that speakers are forced to express. 638

## Forms of inflections

- "basically any modification of the stem will suffice" 638
- concatenative (affixes) or nonconcatenative (prosodic) or both
- zero morphemes
- syncretism is common
- suppletion (changes of stem within paradigm )is common
  - paradigms generally only associated with subset of syntactic class. Same inflection often radically different in form between words.

## Meaning of inflection

- Often difficult to determine if meaning is carried by inflection or other part of the construction, e.g. preposition + case in Indo-European languages. 640

- conflate categoreis, e.g. case and number

# The nature of paradigms

- Each class often has one paradigm that productively accommodates now coinages and loans. 644

- Citation forms: [Arabic case is very odd.]

  > In an inflected language, inflected words do not occur without their inflectional morphemes. Even if a speaker is merely listing vocabulary items, each word will instantiate a value in its paradigm. The citation form represents a privileged value in the paradigm [...]. Usually the citation form also performs the role of a base form, serving both as the formal prototype for the remainder of the paradigm (starting from the base form it is easiest to describe all the other inflectional forms of a word) and as the semantic prototype, since it is the most autonomous form.

- "syncretism [...] is merely a case of homophony" 644

- Words without inflection: 645
  - "a few lexical items that have no paradigm at all" are often tolerated.
  - Typically borrowed words with inappropriate shape. Often given derivational morphemes in order to be inflected.

- Some forms may be missing for certain words. Often on logical grounds.
