# Eisele, John. 2018. “One Path or Multiple Paths: Munther Younes on the Integrated Approach to Arabic Instruction.” Al-ʿArabiyya: Journal of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic 51: 1–23.

- Wrong to identify ESA as the written form of MSA. 3

- Younes (2015)
  - is polemical rather than dispassionate. 4
  - claims are not proven or exemplified. 4

- Arguments for dialect at beginner's level: 
  - similarity between varieties, but can also be used to teach *fuṣḥā* in elementary courses. 4
  - foreigner who only knows *fuṣḥā* is laughed at. But so is foreigner who knows dialect from another country, e.g. speaking Egyptian in Morocco. 5

- Rather than finding what is correct, *fuṣḥā* or dialect first, there may be multiple approaches, some better for certain situations or aims. 5

- Approaches evaluated for how they deal with
  - *Linguistic reality*: whether the student confronts or is shielded from natural language variation.
  - *linguistic dissonance*: having to learn several varieties at once
    - may be detrimental if tackled early on. May not by possible to avoid, but should be taken in consideration. 8
  - *Linguistic choice*: what variety is chosen

- Speaking biologically (really listening, speaking and interacting) and speaking mono logically are separate skills, often calling for separate varieties in Arabic. 13
