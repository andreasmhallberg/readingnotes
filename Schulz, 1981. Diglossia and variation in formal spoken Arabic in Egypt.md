# Schulz, D.E., 1981. Diglossia and variation in formal spoken Arabic in Egypt, Ann Arbor: Unpublished Ph. D. thesis.

- C[airene]A och MSA are "well-defined". C[airene]E[educated]A is not. 4-6

- Data: 
    - various radio broadcasts. 12
    - 49 speakers, 1000 p. transcription. 14

- Definition of level – "consists of a constellation of linguistic features that occur together". 17

- Deference between clear code-switching between levels and mixing on “even keel”. [Cf. Holes. 18]

- Data contradicts level theory: 19 

    > According to Badawi's model, the speech in my sample should form a 'level' in which the same linguistic features are used by every speaker (those features of the third level); but to the contrary I have found that we get a very broad spectrum of speech, ranging form what is almost 'pure' colloquial, to what is almost 'pure' classical.

- Dialects affixes on SA stem, but not vise versa. 87. 
    - Three instances of icraab on dialectal stem, one of which is unclear. 167


- Counts case markers. Excludes pause position [how?] and adverbs. 103

- Hamza: 123
    - "In the less formal styles [than recitation] of MSA the glottal stop usually remains with its vowel as /ʾal-/, and the proceeding word retains its grammatical ending."
    - In informal styles also the ending disappears.

- Features investigated:
    1. Verb usage (dialect/MSA stems)
    2. /ṯ/, /ḏ/, /ẓ/, /j/, /q/
    3. Icraab
    4. Relative pronouns (*allaḏī/illi*)
    5. Complementizers
    6. Negations
    7. *-uh* object

- Numbers pronounced dialectally by everyone. 132

- No correlation between uses of MSA phonemes. [individual strategies]. 132

- /q/ unique positions as level raiser. 133

- Case:
    - Nom and Gen – No difference in marking between definite and indefinite. 
    - Acc - Much more marking in definite. Explained by orthography. 13
    - Ambiguous *i*: 139
    
        > The genitive marker /i/, and in CEA [i or schwa] is often used as a transitional vowel between words. It could be that the genitive figures are slightly inflated, since I may have counted some transitional vowels as genitive endings.
    - *Tāʾ marbūṭa* less often marked for case. 141 
    - "17 of 49 [speakers] used no iʿraab on nouns. [...] 11 of 49 used used iʿraab more than 5% of the time". 137

- subjunctive more often used than indicative. 137

- SV largely as common as VS. 148

- "discourse drift" level lowered in prolonged speech. Common in monologues. 156-59

- Hierarchy of classical features. Not strict - order varies between speakers. 163
    1. [q], hāḏa (adjective)
    2. MSA verbs, *an*
    3. MSA negations, *inna*, *mabni*, Acc on indefinites.
    4. *Anna*, *allaḏī*, *jīm*
    5. MSA suffix (3.ms), *hāḏa* (pronoun)
    6. Icraab, [ṯ], VS
    7. [ẓ]
    8. classical numbers

- List of levels of formality in definite article. 123

- Wide variation that cannot be explained by "topic, education, emphasis, interviewer, or education". Anti-level. 183

- Experience in formal speech may explain variation. 185
