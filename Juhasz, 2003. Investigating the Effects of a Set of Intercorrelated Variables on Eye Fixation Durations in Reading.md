[Followed up in Juhasz & Rayner (2006).]

- Investigate effect on fixation measures of
  - word frequency
  - subjective familiarity - subjective ratings
  - word length - nr of characters
  - concreteness - Abstract words are named more slowly but only out of context. 1313
  - age of acquisition (AoA) - subjective ratings.
    - Typical finding: "words acquired earlier are responded to quicker and more accurately".
    - Subjective ratings correlate highly with objective measures.

- These factors highly correlated, difficult to untangle.

- All five independently influence fixation times, but at different stages of the process (i.e. difference in firs, single, gaze, total fixations). 1316

- AoA effects from lexical decision task are generalizable to normal reading. 1317
