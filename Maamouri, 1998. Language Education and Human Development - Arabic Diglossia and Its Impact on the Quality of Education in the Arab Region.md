# Maamouri, M., 1998. Language Education and Human Development: Arabic Diglossia and Its Impact on the Quality of Education in the Arab Region. 

- Poor quality of Arabic education: 5

  > The educational structures of the Arab countries are currently characterized by their growing inadequacy and deterioration, the questionable relevance of their curricula, and the unacceptably low quality of their output.

- Status planning in Mashreq, corpus planning in Magreb. 23

- "an important political and cultural battle raged for more than half a century in Egypt and Syria, between the Classicists and those who opposed them." 24 Classisists best represented by language academies. 24

- Tunisia and Morocco have chosen to accept French for the time being. 25

- Arabization used for political point taking. 27

- Vignette about children's motivation to learn dialect/SA/European languages. 27-30

- "The elaboration of a common core pan-Arabic standard might however, be possible. Here again, important research would be in great need." 37

- Dialect is rejected: 38

  > The common ideologically acceptable and politically correct attitude with regards to the place of the colloquials in Arabic diglossia is total non-accaptence of colloquial Arabic forms in most formal situations. 

- Linguistic insecurity: 42

  > The intermingling of *fushas* and colloquials in the Arab region and the lack of clear-cut linguistic marking barriers aggravate the insecurity of the young learners who seem confused by what constitutes *fusha* in the Arabic forms which surround them and what does not.

- Centrality of case and mood in language instruction: 53

  > The exercise of guessing the correct *iʿraab* has become a central activity in the classroom

- Recommendations: 
  1. "[Pedagogy] needs to incorporate the norms and behaviors of the language community in the classroom in order to increase immediate relevance of the learning process by connecting it to the learner’s personal experience, familiar topics and concrete real-world concerns." 61
  2. Early colloquial Arabic reading. 63
  3. total script visibility 65
