# Salib, Maurice Boulos, 1979. Spoken Literary Arabic: oral approximation of literary Arabic in Egyptian formal discourse. Phd. Dissertation. University of Calefornia

[Spoken Literary Arabic - equated with Badsawī's 'muṯaqqafīn'. 86. Yet compares it with Harrel's Egyptian Radio Arabic.]

- Not result of speakers trying to speak LA by, but developed through such attempts. 5

- Arisen from the modern mass education broadcast media. 9-10

- SLA not use to facilitate interdialectal communication. 14

- Functional endings are marginal. 16

- Tansformation: L[evel]1 (dialect) -> L2 -> L2+.  
  - L1 to L2 through lexical substitution.
  - L2 to L2+ grammatical features specific to LA (icraab, verb in f.pl. etc.).  ”stylistic embellishment”.
  - L2+ somewhat different for speakers of different dialects, e.g. Egyptian demonstratives.

- Raising from dialect to SLA according to rules:
  1. subtitution of content item
  2. substitution of functional item
  3. L2+
