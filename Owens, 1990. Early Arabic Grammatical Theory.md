[Chap 4--11 not read.]

- The schools
  - Traditional historiography, classical description by Anbārī (d. 1181). 1
    - Basra and Kufan schools during Ummayad dynasty
    - Basra: Sībawayhi, al-Axfaš, Masinī, Mubarrad
    - Kufa: Kissāʾī, al-Farrāʾ, Ṯaʿlab
    - Final dominance of Basra explained by highly developed methodology and classifications, and analogical reasoning. Kufans focused on anomalous examples, and less to methodology or system. 2 
    - "Baghdad" school during Abbasid era. Based on Sībawayhi's methodology.
  - Critique of traditional description (Weil 1913)
    - Oral tradition of learning made real opposition between schools in different cities impossible. Sībawayhi and al-Farrāʾ (main protagonists of the two schools) never met.
    - Small theoretical differences. Anbārī often struggle to categorize scholars.
