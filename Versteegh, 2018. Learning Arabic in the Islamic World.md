- Universal use of traditional grammars *Alfiyya* and *Ājurrūmiyya* in all of the Islamic world. 246

  > As a result of the general reluctance to introduce new texts in the curriculum and the fact that most language teaching was text-based, it became had to change anything at all, either in the subjects taught, or in the didactics of language teaching.  

- Reform in Egypt around 1900 to replace traditional teaching material with modern textbooks, *Qawāʿid al-luġa l-ʿarabiyya*. 254
