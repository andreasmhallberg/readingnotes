- Labov's axiom that that stile depends on the amount of attention paid to speech (Labov 1972, 208) replaces by audience design. 147
  - Style differences in radio news broadcast by station as read by same announces. 149
  - "Attention is at most a mechanism of response" enabling speakers to adapt speech to audience. "The mechanisms should not be mistaken for the motive power" 150 

- Socially structured (inter-speaker) variation always have parallel in style (intra-speaker) variation. 151
  - "What is the nature of this interrelation?" Audience design.
  - All stylistic variation originates in social variation: 151
    
   > some linguistic variables will have both social and style variation ["markers"], some only social variation ["indicators"], but none style variaiton only 

  - Hyper style variable = highly affected by style (primarily reading and speaking), and minimally by social categories. 155
  
- "If a variable has no interspeaker variation, it will have no interspeaker variation." 158
  - Seen in language death. If speakers only have family members to speak with, develop no formal register.

- Audience design
  - "Intraspeaker variation must be explained in common terms with the interspeaker variation from which it derives." 159
  - Roles in concentrically expanding circles. Explains style shifts to smaller and smaller degree.
    - speaker
    - addressee
    - auditor
    - overhearer
    - eavesdropper
  - Reinterpretation of existing data on these grounds. 161-78
  - Topic and setting affect style only by association with addressees. 180
    - Topic-designed shift will not exceed that of audience designed shift. 179
    - Incongruency between topic and addressee may be impossibly  to satisfy. 181

- Initiative style design
  - Initiatives of style shift that deviate from a "normal" style for that addressee. 184
    - redefinition by the speaker of the relationship with the addressee. 185
      
      > Such shifts appear to be powerful just because they treat addressees as if they were somenone else.

- Referee design.
  - Style shift away from speaker.
  - *Ingroup referee design*: marks ingroup identity that excludes addressee. 187
    - Eg., refusal to change language to that of addressee, increasing youth language features as rebellious act when talking to teacher.
    - Confrontational and short lived. 188
  - *Outgroup referee design*: style shift to group of which speaker of addressee are not part.
    - Diglossia: adaption to "dialect of an external referee, distanced either by space or time" 189
    - Colonial language often referee design.
    - Institutionalized: 189

      > This attitude has frozen the momentary phenomenon of initiative shift into a norm in which the whole speech community acknowledges the status of the referee language. Because both speaker and addressees share the same reference point, the shift to referee speech can be widespread and prolonged.

    - Speaker has no direct access to outgroup and no direct feedback. "lacks adequate models of outgroup speech" and never fully masters it, even in diglossia. 190

      > The more distance the referee outgroup, the less you as a speaker know their code. But happily, your audience knows the outgroup code as imperfectly as you do, and is thus unlikely to question you performance.

    - Imperfect shifts. Focus an few salient features. 190

      > The aim of the referee design is for you speech to put the audience in mind of a particular reference group. A few token shifts should successfully convince the immediate audience. 

      - "Turns categorical rule of the target dialect into a variable one." 191

    - Examples:
      - American (inconsistent) pronunciation by British rock singers example of referee design. 194
      - RP in news broadcasts in New Zealand.

- Complete model of audience design typology. 196

- Summary: 197

  > at all levels of language variability, people are responding primarily to other people.
