# Lynch, M., 2006. Voices of the new Arab public: Iraq, al-Jazeera, and Middle East politics today, New York: Columbia University Press.

- Public sphere "is the existence of routine, ongoing, unscripted arguments before an audience about issues relevant to many." 31

- "Only when al-Jazeera refocused the satellites away from entertainment and toward politics---more precisely, toward political argument about Arab issues defined by an Arab identity---did it become a public sphere." 33

- "It was not new media alone that created a new public sphere---it was al-Jazeera's prioritization of politics and its remarkable success in initiation a regionwide public discourse that quickly reached an incredibly widespread and diverse audience." 41
