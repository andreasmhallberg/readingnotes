- "We have emphasised all along that writing is not speech written down, nor is speech writing that is read aloud.´´91

- "It is only after language is written don that it becomes an object accessible to conscious attention and systematic study; so grammar begins with writing, and it codifies the written language. The so-called `traditional grammar’ that came inte the `grammar schools’ was a theory of written language." 97
