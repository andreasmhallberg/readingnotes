# Baalabaki, Ramzi. 2008. The Legacy of the Kitab: Sibawayhi’s Analytical Methods within the Context of the Arabic Grammatical Theory. Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics 51. Boston: Brill.

## Background

- Negative view of later tradition. Sibawayhi's focus on meaning base explanations was x

> ultimately replaced by th epednatic formulae and arigid rules which characterize the owrd of most late authors.

- *Al-Kitāb* is the most reliable sauce for earlier grammatical activity. 11

- S.'s contemporaries made gurneys to the Beduin to gather data. No mention that S. did so. But did talk to Beduin. 25

- List of early works collecting Beduin data. 26-

## Analytical tools

- *Al-Kitāb* is in two equal parts: 31
  1. *naḥw*: "the syntactical relations among the various components of uttrances and the declensional endings which are associated with these relations."
  2. *ṣarf*: "examines words in isolation of structure and includes derivations morphology as well as morphophonology." 
    - *wazn*
    - *iʿlāl*: vowel mutatoin
    - *ziyāda:* augmentation
    - *ḥaḍf:* omission
    - *idġām:* ilḥāq
    - *waqf:* pause
    - *imāla:* fronting

- Terminology. 32
  - Uses terms that deviate from later standardized usage.
  - Words used both in technical and pre-technical sense (*ḥāl, ẓarf, fiʿl*)
    - Talks against foreign influence. Rather natural development or native terminology and concepts. 33
  - Later terms not found in *Al-Kitāb*: 34-5
    - *ism āla*
    - *ištiġāl*
    - *ism maʿnā* (abstract noun)
    - *ism ʿayn* (concrete noun)
    - *nāʾib fāʿil*
    - *tanāzuʿ* (conflict in governance)
    - *jumla*
    - *ajwaf*
    - *ṣīġa*
    - *šamsī/qamarī*

### *Samāʿ*: attested data 

- Data source (*šawāhid*) in Al-Kitāb: 36
  - Quran (447 verses)
  - *ḥadīṯ* ("only a few times")
  - poetry (ca. 1050 lies)
  - Beduin speech (350 idiomatic expressions and speech patters, 41 proverbs)
- Careful to use all types of sources in all chapters. 38
- Data from Tamīmī hand Hijāzī dialects dominate.
- Linguistic variation kept in check by disregarding certain dialectal variants. Attempt not to erode general rules with exceptions. 40 
- Exclusion of *muwallad* poetry from Al-Kitāb must have been influence on later grammarians who rejected this data as *šawāhid*. 42 
- Poets contemporary with S. last legitimate data sources in later tradition.
- Distinguishes between poetry (*šiʿr*) and prose (*kalām*). Different sets of permissabilities. 43

### *Qiyās* (analogy)

- "analogical extension" 47
- Example: Hijāzī *mā* taking accusative complement in analogy with *laysa*, despite not being a verb
- Psychological model: 47

  > It is implicit in the *Kitāb* that the grammarian is thus justified in identifying the rule (here also *qiyās*) which would explain the phonomona of resempblance and analogical extension, the logica being that *qiyās* is primarily the function of the speaker and that the grammarian should be able to unveil the factors behind the speaker's choice of oa cetian case-ending, form, construction. etc.

- The term *qiyās* becomes abstracted in different ways, and comes to mean for example "similarity" more genrally or  morphological pattern. The terms is thus transformed "from a process in the mind of the speaker into an undisputed linguistic reality". 50

- *aqyas*: more regula usage, more canonical. 51

- *Qiyās* used as extension of rules to limit number of anomalies. 56

### *ʿIlla* (cause)

- According to later grammarians there are four parts of *qiyās*: 56
  1. *aṣl* (origin, base)
  2. *farʿ* (subsidiary)
  3. *ʿilla* (casue, reason)
  4. *ḥukm* (rule)

- Most frequent use of the therm *ʿilla* in *Al-Kitāb* is in *xiffa* being the *ʿilla* (cause) for various phonological processes. 59

- Far fetched *ʿilal* used to establish the wisdom of the Arabs. 66
