[Summary of *ṣarf* in the Arabic linguistic tradition]

- root (*aṣl/jiḏr*) vs. 'added' (*zāʾid*) 67
  - Short vowels have nor role in this dichotomy
  - Servers as classification of morphological forms.
- Pattern (*wazn*) 68
  - Short vowels are represented
- *Taṣrīf*: to speak of the patterns a root can appear in.
- *ištiqāw*: "generally implies a directed derivational process"

- Nouns is the basis of all derivation.

- *tarkīb*: compounding, eg. in complex numerals 69

- *Ṣarf* covers
  - morphology
  - morphophonology (described in great detail)
  - phonology


- Morphophonological rules behave differently according to 70
  - word class
  - position in word
  - basic or added sound (*jiḏr/zāʾid*)
  - class of sound
  - proximity to other sounds

- Deviations from system further explained by
  - pardigmatic regularity
  - compensation of other sound loss
  - one operation blocking other
  - frequency of use

- Principles often fit with modern morphological thought.

- Explicit definition of *ṣarf* came late with Ibn Jinni 70

  > Morphogy [ta~s~riyf] deals with  the fixed form of words [*kalim*], while syntax [na~h~w] studies words in their different contexts.

- Aspects of a words form that depend on syntax do not relate to morphology.

- *ta-* part of *ṣarf*, but not *-at*, which is an independent pronoun. 71
