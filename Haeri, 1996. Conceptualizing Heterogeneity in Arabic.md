# Haeri, N., 1996. Conceptualizing Heterogeneity in Arabic. In M.  Doss & C. Miller, reds. Ã‰gypte/Monde arabe, (27-28), ss.301-315.

- Criticize previous research for seeing the "colloquial" as a monolithic whole with which MSA interacts to create variation.

- Extensive critique of Leeds project and ESA:
  - Contradictory statements about what  ESA is. 17
  - Definition of "educated classes" is extremely vague and possibly meaningless: 19 

    > ESA is the "practice" of the "professional classes" and who they are needs no definition since if they speak ESA then they are the professional classes. However the "professional classes" have heterogeneous back grounds in type of education, ideology, sex, social class, religion and other factors. Those who have attended private language school and later receive their graduate degrees in specializations in which a foreign language served as the medium; and those who went to public schools and acquired higher degrees in areas where Classical Arabic served as the medium, are both "educated". And both can become members of the professional classes. Were we to construct a category such as the "speech of the professional classes", we would have to include not only Egyptian Arabic and Classical Arabic (and all their varieties), but also English, French, Italian, German and still other languages. 

  - Do not take ideology into account. 22

- Diverse linguistic experiences lead to diverse linguistic judgments and attitudes:

  > The extreme variation in the degree of knowledge in Classical Arabic on the part of the speakers, the kinds and frequencies of linguistic varieties that they get exposed to throughout their lives, etc., all contribute to non-uniform perceptions regarding the same 'piece of language'.
