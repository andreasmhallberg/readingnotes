## First wave

- Began with Labov's (1966) *Social Stratification of English in New York*. 88
- Found variation dependent on socioeconomic variables, macrosociological categories
  - greater variation and more non-standard forms at bottom.
- *Vernacular* defined as natural, first acquired  speech without alterations "unaffected by socially motivated correction".
- Societal variation reflected in individual speech styles (casual, interview, reading). 89
- 'Style' result of degree of attention to speech, alterations of vernacular
- Gender stratification. Women more standard forms. Interpreted to signal women's greater upward social mobility. 90
- Individuals place in social (macro-)hierarchy -> use of variable

## Second wave

- Incorporated categories derived from ethnographic observations. Categories based on local cultural dynamics. 90
- Started by Milroy (1980)
- Vernaculars that are stigmatized on macrolevel may have prestige on the local level.
- Teenage culture in Detroit, "Jocks" and "burn-outs" marked by linguistic variables. Correlates with local group membership rather than parents' socio-economic status. Implies individual agency. 92 

## Third wave

- Views variation as innate feature of language, a means of creative expression, rather than as effect of social category. 94

- General process
  1. Population becomes salient
  2. Feature in their speech "attracts attention"
  3. Feature is "extracted from its linguistic surroundings and come, on its own, to index membership to the population."
  4. Feature can then be used for indexical value to
     - pejorate (mock speech patterns),
     - lay claims to admired qualities of the population (white youth using black slang)
     - distinctions within population (more authentic, etc.)
  5. Indexical acts make the sign more conventionalized, makes further acts possible.
- Changing indexical landscape "indexical field"
- Speakers active uses of variation rather than passive recipients: 98

  > tailoring linguistic styles in ongoing and lifelong projects of self-construction and differentiation 

- Labov: style is "different ways of saying the same thing". Third wave: styles say different things.
