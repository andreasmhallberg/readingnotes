# Atkinson, J.M., 1982. Understanding formality: the categorization and production of ”formal” interaction. British Journal of Sociology, ss.86–117.

'Formal' conversational procedures are solutions to practical problems in settings with multiple participants.

- Normal conversation as the default: 90

  > a basic procedure used by analysts (whether lay or professional) in identifying actions as 'formal' involves a form of comparative analysis in which a taken for granted knowledge of the organization of conversational interaction serves as the main point of reference.

- "'formality' emerges as a gloss for a myriad of features that can be heard to be 'non-conversational'." 96

- "multi-party gatherings in which a single sequence of interaction is oriented to by all co-present parties" 96

  - requires formal procedures to sustain attention, orderly turn taking an understanding-checking. Normal conversational ruler require close attention to all participants, which is not possible in multi-party gathering. 98

- Conversational checking of who knows who is unpractical in large multi-party gatherings. Formal presentation procedures are required. 106

- Short-turn question and answer format easier to follow by observers. News interview. 108

- Marked receipts (confirmation, 'oh') avoided by professionals in formal settings. Would possibly seem less professional if they did use them. 113
