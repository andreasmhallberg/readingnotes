# Gibbs, Raymond W., Jr. 2010. “Idioms and Formulaic Language.” In The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics, edited by Dirk Geeraerts and Hubert Cuyckens, 697–725.

- Idioms traditionally seen as "bits and pieces of fossilized language" which speakers learn to pair with nine-literal meaning. 697
  - This view has changed radically in recent research.

- Working definition of formulaic language (Wray and Perkins 2000:1):

  > a sequence, continuous or discontinous, of words or oterh meaing elements, which is, or appearrs to be prefabticated: that is, stored and retrieved whole form memory at the time of use, rather than being subjects to generation or analysis by the language grammar.

- Types of formulaicity: 698
  - Sayings: "take the bull by the horns"
  - Proverbs: "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
  - Phrase verbs: "to give in"
  - Idioms: "kick the bucket"
  - Binomials: "hammer and tongs"
  - Frozen similes: "as white as snow"
  - Phrasal compounds: "red harring", "dead-line"
  - Incorporating verb idioms: "to babysit", "to sightsee"
  - Formulaic expressions: "at first sight", "how do you do?"



- The usefuleness of ideoms: 702
  - "to be polite"
  - "to avoid responsibility for the import of what is communicated"
  - "to express ideas that are difficult to communicate using literal language"
  - "to express thought in a compact and vivid manner"

- Formulaic language important for asserting identity and group membership (Wray and Perkins 2000). 702 

> Thus, knowing the right familiar phrase, such as slang, to use in some situation is critical to marking a speaker as having the right status to be considered a valued memeber of some community.

- Idioms are undertook directly without reference to their literal meaning, as shown in experimental research. 704

- Ideoms often cluster rounder basic metaphor
  - LOVE IS A JOURNEY
    - *It's been a long bumpy road.*
    - *We're at a crossroads.*
  - ANGER IS A HEATED FLUID IN A CONTAINER
    - *blow your stack*
    - *flip your lid*
  - Suggests that these metaphors are not dead. Shows "speakers' metaphorical schemes of thought."

- Many idioms are decomposable to the meanings of their separate parts. 706
  - "pop the question" = uttering marriage proposal

- Frozen hierarchy - whether the expression can undergo grammatical manipulation.
  - This can partly be explained by analyzablility. Analyzable (decomposable) Idioms tend to be less frozen. 709
