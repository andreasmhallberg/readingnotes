- The availability of a standard variety is functional. Cf. tools/measurements, etc. 134

- Belief in linguistic correctness: 134

  > In standard language cultures virtually everyone agrees to the idea of linguistic correctness. Some forms are believed to be right and others wrong, and this is generally taken for granted as common sense. Although rules of correctness are actually superimposed on the language from outside, they are considered by speakers to be rules inherent in the language itself.

- Spelling is highly arbitrary yet mistakes are grounds for harsh moral judgments. [Cf. Trudgill 1975] 134

- Discrimination on the basis of language is acceptable, even though it is a proxy for social variables. 135


- Linguists teach that language is the possession of the native speaker, standard language ideology that it is the possession of only a few "who have the authority to impose the rules of language on everyone else." 135

- Education to teach people their own language: 163

  > people find it reasonable to say that children go to school to 'learn English', when in fact inpre-school years they have already acquired the basis of spoken English grammar and phonology.

- Governing standard is not the elites but "those who depend for their livelihood to on communicating widely in society; for example, business people, lawyers, journalists." [Cf. Jedlicka 1982:62] 137-138

- Policing of standard language believed to be necessary for the survival of the language. 139
