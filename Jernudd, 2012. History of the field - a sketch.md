- Four historical types of language planning: *pre-modern, early modern, modern, post-modern* 18

1. Pre-modern 18
   - E.g., the French Academy. Created "during the time when European elites began to use the local vernacular languages in functions which had up that time been reserved for Latin"

2. Early modern 19-
   - 19th century

   - Languages associated with new Herderian nation states (Slovak, Czech, Norwegian, Finnish)
   - Selection and construction of varieties to become standard, and standardization (grammar, orthography) and controlled expansion of lexicon.
   - Soviet in 20s and 30s.
     - Features also of modern type.
     - Standardization of languages for linguistic minorities.
     - Promotion of Russian associated with Tzarian policies.
     - Establishments of tens new alphabets and orthographies.

3. Modern 21
   - Focus in micro-management of standard language.
   - Negligence of questions of linguistic diversity.
   - Prague school
   - "Classic language planning".
     - Represented by Fishman, Heugen, Ferguson  
     - Focus in policy for developing countries after end of colonial system after WWII.
     - Language planning as "a set of rational [...], yet politically authorized activities (fact-finding; planning goals, strategies, and outcomes; implementation; and feedback)" 25
     - Application on level of nation state and including entire society. 

4. Post-modern 27
   - 1980s onward
   - Represented by Williams, Tollefson, Blommeart
   - Critique of classic language planning as perpetuating inequality.  
   - "rather free-wheeling, discursive methodology" 27

- 'acquisition planning' next to status and corpus planning. 29

- Shift to value diversity and manage "ecology" of languages. 30
  - Focus on (linguistic) human rights, plurality, and language revitalization.
  - Fishman's (1991, 2001) Reversing Language Shift model. 8 degrees of language vitality. 31
    - Criticized for placing undue focus on family, not on socioeconomic factors, and the disruption of inter-generational relations due to mobility.

- Language Management framework 33-
