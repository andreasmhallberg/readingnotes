# Curzan, A., 2014. Fixing English: prescriptivism and language history, New York: Cambridge University Press.

- Example of prescriptive work: The Grammatically Corrects Handbook by Ellie Grossman. In radio show callers call in with worries of their own faulty usage. Author advices repeating correct forms while in the shower and using PostIt notes on fridge.

- Four strands of prescriptivism: 24

  > - Standardizing prescriptivism: rules/judgements that aim to promote and enforce standardization and 'standard' usage [as against non-standard usage].
  > - Stylistic prescriptivism: rules/judgments that aim to differentiate among (often fine) points of style within  standard usage.
  > - Restorative prescriptivism: rules/judgments that aim to restore earlier, but now relatively obsolete, usage and/or turn to older forms to purify usage.
  > - Politically responsive prescriptivism: rules/judgments that aim to promote inclusive, nondiscriminatory, politically correct, and/or politically expedient usage.

- Description of stylistic prescriptivism: "There is an understanding that this is a nicety of usage, a nicety that distinguishes those who "know better" from those who don't, but it does not distinguish standard English speakers from nonstandard English speakers." Example: *hopefully*. 33 

- Quotes Milroy & Milroy p.3y, correct usage is felt as law: 30

  > The effect of codification and prescription has been to legitimise the norms of formal registers of standard English rather than the norms of everyday spoken English. Codifiers have legislated and prescribers have tried to put the legislation into effect. One result of this is that there is a general belief that there is only one form of correct, i.e. legitimate, English, and a feeling that colloquial and non-standard forms are perverse and deliberate deviations from what is approved by 'law' i.e. they 'illegitimate'.

- The effect of prescriptive book selling millions may be limited on actual speech, but as a discourse effects ideology and linguistic insecurity. 41ff

- Verbal hygiene in the workplace accepted by the Wallsteet Journal. 49

- The awareness of prescriptive notion of a construction may affect how speakers use that construction. Self-comment or comment of others' usage reproduce prescriptive notions. 59

- Example on questionable prescriptions (beginning in the 18th century, included in MS Word's grammar checker), banning: 69
  - stranded prepositions
  - double negatives
  - generic he
  - split infinitives

- "The number of grammars skyrocketed over the course of the late eighteenth century throughout the nineteenth century, and grammarians during this period changed the tone of grammatical admonishments: the discourse was no longer just about improving style and rhetoric but also about identifying and eliminating error." 69
