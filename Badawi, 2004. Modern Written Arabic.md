- Case markers mostly absent in writing: 20-21

  > Case and mood markers, begin mostly vocalic, seldom appear in MWA [Modern Written Arabic]

- Most case markers have no presence in writing, and most often not in reading aloud: 33

> [Omission of case inflection] has now been generalized for the reading of all varieties of Arabic up to the highest levels, though a fully vocalized reading style will always be invoked if the solemnity of the context dictates it. It will be apparent from the tables below that the reading of MWA in pausal form has the effect of obliterating most of the inflectional system.

- Adverbs with *-an*: 150
  - "dep. indef. nouns functioning autonomously as adverbs"
  - Traditional analysis as adjectives to absolute objects not relevant in modern Standard Arabic Arabic.
