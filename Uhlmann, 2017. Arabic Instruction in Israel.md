- Arab students difficulties with Arabic grammar at the university
  - Chock for Arabs studying Arabic at the university: 3

    > A common leitmotif among Arabic graduates of Arabic who pursued an academic career is precisely that completely unexpected, incomprehensible, debilitating encounter with Arabic grammar at the university.

  - Students and teachers unaware of the problem of incommensurable systems. Students cannot pinpoint difficulty and teachers ascribe Arab students difficulty to "complete lack of elementary background knowledge of grammar, itself the result of supposedly inferior schooling in the Arab sector." 8 

- Personal background of author in relation to subject. 4-9
  - "Lévi-Bruhlian moment" - personal experience of non-translateability, incomprehension of system of knowledge. [This personal experience may be a prerequisite to understand the significance of the probelm.]

  > the moment when one realists that one understands, the words, the sentences and the syntax, but fails to apprehend the progression of ideas and the underlying logic of a given augment or narrative.

  - May lead either to an experience of personal failure or to a development of metacognitive analysis of systems of knowlded.

- Attraction of Arabic for non-Arabs (Jews in Israel): 5

  > The attraction of Arabic included the gratification of mastering a code, along with the seduction of courting danger.

- Oreintalis-pholologist cycle of non-proficiency in Arabic. 37

- Jewish experience grammar as a coherent system applicable to a variety of languages. Arab students experience grammar as "incoherent and discontinuous across languages". 48

- Verb conjugation highly valued in orientalist tradition. Desinential inflection highly valued in Arab tradition. 50

- Background of Arabic Linguistic tradition and its affect on modern educational practices in the Arab world. 52-66
  - Pre-modern mode of pedagogy with pre-modern educational aims transferred by the inertia of tradition to modern setting with modern aims of mass education.
  - Doing *iʿrāb* trumps understanding: 55

    > Correct conventionalized recitation of grammatical analysis is the measure of educational success in this approach. Comprehension of concepts of grammar is relegated to secondary importance as is the understanding of the given text or of the semantic effects of grammatical manipulation.

  - Connection with Islam makes new modes of grammar instruction appear as threatening or as introducing as "slippery slope" of rendering traditional knowledge obsolete. 57
  - Aim of modern language instruction is to still generation of correct language forms. Aim of pre-modern language instruction (as in the Arabic tradition) is to interpret and decode fixed text.

  - Pro-modern pedagogy in modern context: 64

    > Arabic-grammar instruction is thus left mired in historic incompatibility between, on the one hand, pre-modern approaches to grammar instruction and the cognitive habits it presupposes, characteristics which still inhere in contemporary Arab Arabic grammar instruction by force of inertia, and on the other hand, the realities of contemporary schooling.

- Incommensurabelity of the grammatical systems. 89-102
  - Transition of terms between traditions seem on the surface to work, which gives an illusion of translate ability and mutual understanding. Breaks down when applied in analysis.
  - In the Arabic tradition verb morphology does not contained the dimensions of person or number. Pronominal suffixes are in the area of syntax. 99
    - Verb conjugation becomes nonsensical from this perspective. Personal suffixed are separate words and can only be added in context. [Cf. Swedish "jag går, du går, han går".] May account for difficulties Arab students find verb conjugation. 103
  - Orientalist vs. Arabic typology of verb forms. Forms I-X vs *mazīd*. 105
  - Different aims: 116
    - Arabic tradition explains existing texts. Provide examples and proceeds to deduce grammatical rules.
    - Orientalist tradition present rules to generate language. Provides rules and proceeds to give generated examples.
