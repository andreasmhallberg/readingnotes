# Frazier, Lyn, and Keith Rayner. “Making and Correcting Errors during Sentence Comprehension: Eye Movements in the Analysis of Structurally Ambiguous Sentences.” Cognitive Psychology 14, no. 2 (1982): 178–210.

- Garden-path theory of sentence parsing: 180
  - *Late closure*: material is syntactically attached to preceding material.
  - *Minimal attachment*: Attach incoming material using as few nodes as possible (smallest possible syntactic tree)

- Three theories of how readers perform reanalysis:
  - *Forward reanalysis*: Start from beginning of sentence
  - *Backward reanalysis*: Work backwoard
  - *Selective reanalysis*: Regress to relevant region. 

- Eye-tracking experiment with garden paths. [Suspect in that commas are not used and would have disambiguated sentences.]

- [No data on anwers to comprehension question.]

- Readers react to garden-paths with either. 196
  - *Chaos*: Long fixations and short forward saccades. Unable to reanalyze sentence.

    > Occasionally, however, the parser will plow on through the sentence after incompatible information is received. 200

  - *Disruption*: regression and reanalysis.

- Regressions to disambiguation region or start of sentence. Supporting selective reanalysis. 199

- Parser operate only on the preferred analysis (garden path theory).
