[Theoretical discussion on learner types, empirical results of questionnaire of learning types and of usefulness of study manual.]

- Study conducted on Dutch Open University Students
  - Heterogeneous student population. 648

- Synthesized previous research in student learning activities: *regulating activities* and *processing activities*. 649
  - Processing activities Normally, teachers take over some of these activities.:
    - *relating*
    - *concretisizing*
    - *analyzing*
    - *structuring*
    - *presonalizing*
    - *being active*
    - *memorizing and rehearsing*
  - regulating activities:  651
    - *orientating*
    - *planning*
    - *monitoring*
    - *testing*
    - *diagnosing*
    - *repairing*
    - *evaluating*
    - *reflecting*

- Students' view of leering connected to what they view as good teaching: 653
  - learning as unaltered intake of knowledge - likes to have everything arranged and regulated
  - learning as knowledge construction - like open forms of education and to take more responsibility in designing learning activities.

- All students find all regulating activities important, but differ in views of who should do them. Unaltered intake of knowledge fins all regulating activities part of teaching, not of learning. **Therefore did not include them in studies.** 653--4

- Motivation three types: *intrinsic, extrinsic, achievement*. 654 

- Orientation types: *vocational, academic, personal*.

- Learning style: tendency to use certain set of regulating activities spontaneously. 654 

- Detailed study instructions
  - To much regulating of studies may be harmful if: 655--6

    > when educations takes over or continuously activates processing or regulating activities that students already spontaneously employ, this may have a harmful effect on their learning results and on their skill in selfregulated learning.  

  - Entwistle (1985): detailed study instructions may lead to better study results but be negative for student independence and foster surface approaches to learning. 656
 
  - May have a positive *model/scaffolding functions*
    - Should then be waned off.

- Results from questionnaire (151 complete responses of 700 send outs)
  - Students with prior higher educating less prone to see learning as intake of presented knowledge, more regulating activities. 664
  - Learning styles do not change rapidly without intervention. 679
  - Passing exams is related to few signs.
