# Mazraani, N., 1997. Aspects of Language Variation in Arabic Political Speech-making, Richmond: Curzon Press.

- Material from three speakers --- Nasser, Qaddafi and Hussayn - referred to as Egyptian, Libyan and Iraqi data.
 
- Pause segments judged in scale of dialect-MSA on basis of recedes of MSA features. 39

- "?i`rāb [...] is an optional MSA extramarker and does not need to occur to define the verb as MSA". 65

- MSA is used for: 189
    1. "constructing an abstract argument"
    2. "recalling historical events"
    3. "expanding new political ideas, and axioms"
- Dialect is used "when the speaker for instnace explains and specifies": 189
    1. "his political programme"
    2. "his conversations with various leaders"
    3. "his personal experience"

- ʿAbd an-Nāṣir has sharp shifts between MSA and dialect, can maintain very formal style. More mixed in Ḥusayns and Qaḏḏafī's speeches. 191

- When switching to MSA all speakers have in their speech: 195-6
    1. Past plural *-ū* (Libya, Egypt) or *-ūn* (Iraq). The ending "*-ūna* is apperantly felt to be too formal to be occuring in these speech contexts." 
    2. Deletion of short unstressed vowel.
    3. "The relative pronoun ?illi is pervasive in all three sets of data, since the MSA chaises alla\uline{dh}ī, allatī, alla\uline{dh}īna are felt too formal."
    4. In Libyan and Egyptian data *-it* for *tāʾ marbūṭa* "coocuring with MSA elements".
    5. *-it* for 1s past in Iraqi data.
    6. (196) "Prefix *bi-* is extremely widespread and routinely cooccurs even with markedly MSA elements."
