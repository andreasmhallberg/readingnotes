# Mejdell, G., 2006. Mixed styles in spoken Arabic in Egypt: somewhere between order and chaos.  Boston: Brill

- Level models tend to be: 47 

> flawed by lack of, or only minimal, empirical support, and turn out to be difficult to apply to natural data.

- Data: academic panel discussion and seminar. 68

- Not considering case since dropping them does not make dialect. 75

- Case endings only studied in connection with enclitic pronouns:
  1. Fewer Gen marked in *iḍāfa* than after prep. 368
  2. Acc in direct object marked directly after verb. 369

- Conclusion: speakers react differently on similar situation.
  - No stable ESA
  - But: inter-speaker constancy, "speakers tend to rank equally high or low in their relative usage level of SA and E[egyptian ]A[rabic] variants on all features.". 376-377

- Graphemic representation important for notions of correctness. Ref till Trudgill 1986. 

- Hierarchy of usage of standard variant, different for all speakers. 382

- Dominant language vs. matrix language. 390

- No fatigue effect on diglossic variables, discourse drift. 395
