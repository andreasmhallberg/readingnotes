- Orthography
  - Distinction between phonemic [word internal] and morpho-syntactic diacritics. 3
  - Few skilled readers master case and mood inflection.
  - Arabic has two orthographies, with and without diacritics.

- Diglossia
  - Vowel reduction in dialects affects mainly on short vowels and hence does not clash with orthography. This "might result in readers paying less attention" to diacritics. 4

- Lack of correlation between reading accuracy and comprehension in previous research may be explained by failure to distinguish word phonemic [word internal] and morpho-syntactic diacritics. 4

- Children go from linear phonological encoding to identification of form and root around 2nd grade, which does not rely on diacritics. 5
  - These "morpho-orthographic" recoding mechanism emerges naturally.

- There is a process advantage for dialectal words over standard words. 6

- Diglossia undermines processing in reading. 6
