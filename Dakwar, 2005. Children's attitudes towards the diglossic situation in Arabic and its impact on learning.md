Informal interviews with school children in Palestine.

- "there is a scarcity in studies examining educational methodologies, knowledge and attitude development within a diglossic framework" 76

- "No student remarked on morphosyntactc differences between Fusha and PCA." 82

- "Many children reported to be 'transferring' from one language variety to the other during reading and writing." 82
