- Following European adoption of vernacular as standard language untenable: 233
  1. lack of written/teaching material
  2. resilience against using vernacular in H functions
  3. religious-political ideology to have language as unifying factor

- Case is complicated. "Given the linguistic complexity of Standard Arabic (especially the case the linguistic mood and case-marking system)" 232

- Statistics on diglossic words wit Israeli-Arabic five year olds: 237
  1. 40.6% of lexical types forms that are predictibly phonetically different in dialect and SA (*dhahab/dahab 'gold*).
  2. 38.2% types uniquely dialectal (*ḥāṭ/wadaʿa*).
     [30.9% in the text, which is a typo. (Saiegh-Haddad, personal communication, 2018-03-30)]
