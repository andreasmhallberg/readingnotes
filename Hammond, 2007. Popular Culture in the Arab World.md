# Hammond, A., 2007. Popular Culture in the Arab World: arts, politics, and the media, Cairo: American University in Cairo Press.

- "Today, over five decades later [after the end of World War II], pop culture has finally succeeded in bringing the peoples together where fifty years of politics failed." 2

- Arab nationalism strong due to popular culture: 2-3

    > Arab nationalism is very much alive and well --- perhaps more than Western observers, obsessed with political Islam, have realized. Modern media and communication have increased the sheer volume of those shared cultural elements and further marginalized those aspects of the region's cultural profile that do not fin into the wider picture.

- Importance of Aljazeera for Arab unity: 15

    > A revolution in Arabic-language television has also helped bring the region closer together. Qatar-based satellite channel al-Jazeera has played a key role here, putting in motion fierce TV competition for the huge Arabic-speaking audience of the Middle East and its diasporas in the West. Watched by millions of Arab viewers across the Middle East, Europe, and North America, taboo-breaking al-Jazeera has established itself as a forum for debate ob human rights, fundamentalism, religion, and corruption, offending just about every Arab state in the process.

- Arabic actually unites: 54

    > The reality is that the language, in all its forms, is unifying the region as it never has done before. Modern communications, entertainment, media, politics, and business have facilitated more linguistic unity and mutual understanding than ever in the past.

- Tunisian daily newspapers written in dialect. 56

- El-Badawi gives example of five levels from television commercials (paraphrasing Badawi): 64

    > The highest level [level 5] is used for admonitory commercials promoting water conservation conservation or sexual chastity to combat AIDS. The second level down [level 4] is employed as the male 'voice of reason' or scientific voice, which often appears voice-overs to banking or car advertisement. At the middle level [3] things are a bit more intimate: a family doctor talks to the camera, lecturing on the quasi scientific properties of a brand of toothpaste, the protective quality of a baby diaper, or the curative powers of a certain medicine. But most ads on Arabic national television are delivered on the next level [4], the 'standard colloquial', of each region, which is reserved for object of indulgence such as food and fancy clothes. A small number of commercials use pure, 'mother-tongue' colloquial language [level 5] for goods aimed at the lowest stratum of society. 64
