- Study of instant message communication amongst female university students in UAE. 

- Geographically different conventions. OO for long o in English colonies and OU in French colonies. [10]

- ' for dotted letters (e.g., '7) [13]

- Variation in representation of x ('7 or 5) but individuals are consistent. [13]

- Arabizi used to signal intimacy outside of CMC (computer mediated communication) [15]

- "short vowels are also represented in many cases" [16]

- "consistent use of L [in definite article] regardless of its pronunciation" [17]

-"AA [Arabizi] involves a combination of transcription of spoken language and mediation from properties of the Arabic and Latin writing systems." [19]

- Dialects are now routinely written: [20]

  > AA represents extended written use of the UAE vernacular. This variety has previously been written down only in very brief texts, in specialized genres such as poetry, cartoons and linguistic studies. Now, however, under the combined pressure of technical and social change, it is being used routinely in written form, for everyday interjectional purposes.
