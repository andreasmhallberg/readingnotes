- Diem (1973) interpretation of Nabatean (Southern Jordan, 100 BC), oldest written Arabc, had no case. 55

- Distribution of three-part case system in Semitic languages suggest that not present in Proto-Semitic. 59

- Neutralization of case (in the case of Classical Arabic in pause) as traces of caseless variety.  
 
- Sibawayh recorded what appears to be free variation in vase marking (nom-acc) 65--7

- Sibawayh describes various transformatins in pause that are not related to case-loss in modern dialects: 69
    - case vowels change form
    - alif maqsuura -> ay
    - case vowel -> epenthesis bakru -> bakur
    - pausal forms of *faalii* are *faali*, *fallii* and *faal*, dialects have only *faali*

    > I think it over selective to argue that the modern dialects arose from pausal forms, when the main piece pf evidence supporting this position in Sibawayh would appear to be that one only of four possible ways of pronouncing case vowels in pausal position in by deleting the vowel altogether.

- Theory that loss of case effect of L2-acquisition. 70

    > Why should they have had such a problem with case? Moreover, what was really dropped was short vowels, among which were found the cases. Even on the unlikeyl situation that the cases were too difficult for non-Arabs to learn, conceptual difficulty can certainly not be invoked to explain the disappearance of, sy the *-a* from *ʾayna* 'where'.
