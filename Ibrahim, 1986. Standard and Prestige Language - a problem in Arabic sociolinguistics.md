MSA is not the prestige variety. The assumption that it is has led to misinterpretation of data. E.g. women accommodates to a higher degree towards prestige L, not to H.

- If H has prestige then the language of the uneducated who have not access to H cannot be socially stratified = absurd. 118

- Backed up by research: Holes/Bahraun, Palva/koinization. 119-20

- Proof for "supra-dialectal [prestige] L": 121
  1. common features (fonologiska och syntaktiska)
  2. Mutually intelligible
  3. Expands

- H option for persons who do not which to use stigmatized forms but for whom prestige-L is posh or not accessible. 124

- "Standard Arabic H is socially neutral and unmarked with respect to the speaker's class.’‘ 124
