# Braze, David, Donald Shankweiler, Weijia Ni, and Laura Conway Palumbo. “Readers’ Eye Movements Distinguish Anomalies of Form and Content.” Journal of Psycholinguistic Research 31, no. 1 (2002): 25–44. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014324220455.

Compares eye-movement patterns in syntactic and pragmatic anomalies. 

- Stimulus
  - 36 target sentences, 72 fillers. 31 
  - 25% of filler contained anomalies "so that anomalous target items were not conspicuous." 31

- Procedure
  - fixation point at start of sentence used for calibration. 31
  - comprehension questions after 24 targets and 12 fillers.

- Measurements
  - first pass reading times ("summed fixation durations within a region, beginning with the first fixation inside the region and ending with, but not including, the first subsequent fixation outside the region." 31)
  - and number of regressions
  - regression landing sites (end of regression chain) 32

- Results
  - "dramatically more regressions" (.37 vs. .10) from syntactically anomalous verb region than in control, but not in pragmatic anomalies. 34  
  - pragmatically anomalous sentences more regressions alter in sentence after anomalous verb. 

- Discussion. 39
  - Reaction to syntactic anomalies immediate bet disappear later in sentence.
  - Reaction to pragmatic anomalies not immediate but lingers and peaks at end of sentence, with regressions to anomalous verb.
