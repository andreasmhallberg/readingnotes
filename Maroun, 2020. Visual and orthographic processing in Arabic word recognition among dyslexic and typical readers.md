- Arabic orthography has two forms: shallow vowelled and deep unvowelled. 3

- Three types of diacritics: 3
  - short vowels
  - mophosyntactic
  - other

- Participants: 4
  - 4th graders
  - 6th graders normal
  - 6th graders dyslectic

- Measures 5-
  - reading speed and accuracy of vowelled and unvowelled words and non-words.
  - orthographic processing
  - Test battery of non-linguistic skills (visual discrimination, etc.)
 

- Results:
  - Diacritics slowed word recognition for all groups. 11
  - All groups could easily distinguish similar letters. 13
  - Phonological ability strongest predictor for accuracy. 14
  - Orthographic abilities [direct route] strongest predictor for speed. 14
