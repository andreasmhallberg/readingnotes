# Magidow, A., 2012. Explaining Inconsistent Case Marking in Spoken Formal Arabic. Zeitschrift für arabische Linguistik, (55), ss.62–99.

Case endings in speech marking 'saliency' and 'individuation'.

- Strange comments on sources: broadcast date/speaker/date/location "unknown". 65-66

- Saliency is "status of referent in speaker's mind [...] Any type of noun could be viewed as relatively more important than surrounding discourse and therefore have salience marking applied to it." 69 
    - [Circular reasoning. No independent way of testing saliency or individuation.] 
    - [Analysis fuzzy. Practically any word could be interpreted as having saliency or individuation. (Examples 8, 21)]

- *Mā ibhāmiyya* "may also be considered a type of specificity marker" [!] and is thus often marked for case. 78
