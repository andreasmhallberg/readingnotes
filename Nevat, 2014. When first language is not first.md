- Semantic categorization task in Literary Arabic, Spoken Arabic, and Hebrew by Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals.
- fMRi

- Categorization o Literary Arabic words faster and more accurate than Spoken Arabic and Hebrew words. 3393

- Brain activation in Spoken Arabic task similar to observed activation for L2 reading. May indicate sub-lexical phonological processing.

- The first acquired Spoken Arabic and the later acquired Hebrew "'look' like L2 in the written modality".

- Preview oust studies show quicker processing of Spoken Arabic words in auditory input. Literary Arabic has an advantage in visual input (like an L1), and Spoken Arabic has an advantage in auditory input (also like an L1).

- Findings may be and frequency effect, as Spoken Arabic written words are seen less frequently.
