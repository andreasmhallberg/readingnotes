- variable/lacking proficiency in family language. Home language often weaker language. 5
- heritage speakers' language show simplification similar to contanct language situations. 5

- Heritage speakers' language
  - phonology: good compared to L2 speakers of similar morpho-syntactic knowledge. 5
  - vocabulary connected to home and common objects, childhood vocabulary. 6
    - large gaps, difficulty to retrieve or lacking infrequent words. 6
  - morphosyntax: for languages with overt, gender/number/case many errors compared to native speakers. 6
    - Arabic gender/number errors
    - Russian case system reduced to nom. and acc.
  - syntax: loss of agreement patterns leads to fixed word order and over use of pronouns in pro-drop languages. 8
  - Summary: 9

    > under reduced input and output conditions, heritage speakers seem to develop some core aspects of their family language, but their grammatical systems show a marked tendency toward simplification and overregularization of complex patterns and restricted word order.

- basic structural system acquired at age of 3--4, but, 10

  > a great deal of of vocabulary learning; and the acquisition of complex syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, as well as command of different spoken and written registers and pragmatic conventions take place during the school-age period.

- Complete acquisition of family language in heritage language situation depends amongst other things on: 10
  - parental discourse strategies
  - status of the languages in the community
  - availability of speech community beyond the family
  - attitudes toward the language
  - access to education in the language

- Siblings tend to speak majority language with one another and with other heritage language children. 10

- Heritage language speakers not L1 nor L2. Features of both. [Table below quoted]. 12

- Key difference in context of acquisition. L2 learners learn by reading/writing and explanation and are often highly literate. Heritage learners often low literacy or illiterate. 12
