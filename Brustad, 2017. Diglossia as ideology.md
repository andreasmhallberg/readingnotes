Diglossia is a language ideology that associates writing with standard language (*fuṣḥā*). This ideology is now contested.

- Non-standard writing has a long history but has tended to be erased/corrected. 43-

- Diglossia can be analyzed as a standard language ideology. 46-

- Arabic Language Academies are serve ideological rather than practical ends. 48

- Example of a blog post by a language corrector written in mixed form. [Could be done sarcastically.] 50

- Analysis of twitter feed. [Interpretations difficult in there being some confusion on whether the feed is about preserving Arabic script of *fuṣḥā* writing. ] 55-

- Duscussion on CLAW survey.
  - Ratings of correct *fuṣḥā* sentences as *ʿāmmiyya* may be due to the lack of salient *fuṣḥā* particles (*inna, faqad* etc.) 63
  - Standard Language Ideology stronger in Rabat than in Cairo. 64

- *Fuṣḥā* is not written less, there is just more writing generally. 66
