# Heath, Peter. 1990. “Proficiency in Arabic Language Learning: Some Reflections on Basic Goals.” Al-’Arabiyya 23 (1/2): 31–48.

Argues in favor of teaching vernacular Arabic. Good historical overview of Arabic language teaching in the US from 1950. Polemic.

- Historical phases of Arabic teaching at university level in US:

  1. "Grammar-translation and Classical Arabic" 34
     - Before 1950 Arabic was for philologists
     - Interest in religion, philosophy, literature, history
     - Classical Arabic primary sources as teaching materials
     - Knowledge in spoken forms of Arabic exception
     - Presumed good foundation in grammar from other languages and independence in study
     - Method still used in language teaching where passive reading skills is the aim

  2. "The Adio-Lingual Method and the Rise of Modern Standard Arabic" 36
     - American position of world dominance after WWII.
     - "area" centers in universities
     - broad, practical language skills prioritized. 37
     - Textbooks on MSA published
     - Linguistic studies on dialects. Grammars and dictionaries on dialects.
     - EMSA ("the orange book") published 1968
     - Establishment of Center of Arabic Studies Abroad (CASA) 1967
       - Main focus on MSA in CASA tests forced "classicit" teachers to teach MSA.
     - Formed a revolution: 38

       > It is not too much to say that these three developments revolutionized Arabic in instruction in the United States.

- Modern Standard Arabic
  - "Panic" in classically oriented programs in Harvard, Princeton, and Yales when students scored poorly on CASA tests. 39

    > of the three main branches of Arabic (colloquial, classical, and modern), only one was now a passport to the CASA program, with EMSA gradually gaining predominance.

  - Justification for teaching MSA (rather than dialects): 40
    1. standard in all Arabic speaking countries.
    2. linguistic ideal in Arab world. Students should learn "proper, correct" language
    3. students should learn language of elites, not of uneducated

  - MSA only marginally spoken: 41

    > At least 90 percent of the verbal transactions of the Arab world transpire in colloquial. Of the remainging 10 percent that do transpire in modern written Arabic, at leas 90 percent of these are not spoken, they are read: newscasts read over radion or television; univeristy or scholarly lectures read by professors to students of colleages; speeches read by politicians; television of film scripts memorized by actors from written text.

  - Teaching oral prificiency in MSA "is to teach the linguistic exception rather than the rule." 42

    > Indeed, the main problem with teaching students to speak modern "standard" Arabic is thaty they, along with their teachers, are among the few who do speak it! 43

  - All three (classical, MSA, colloquial) needed for full, educated proficiency. Problem is not which to teach but how to teach all three. 45
