- By 9th century Muslims concisely reinterpreted the past according to "Islamic view of history". 265

- For Sibawayh *naḥwiyyūn* meant "those concerned with the way people speak". 266

- With development of linguistic sciences from descriptive in *al-Kitāb* to prescriptive, changed from 'the way people speak' to 'the way *ought* to speak'. 266

- In the 9th history of grammar evolved. 267

- Dogma on *iʿjāz* from first half of 11th century also meant that Arabic was unchangeable. 270
