- In studies where the critical region is one word, results are reported on: 329
  - first fixation duration single fixation duration
  - gaze duration (all fixations before leaving word)
  - total time (all fixations) 
  - go past time a.k.a regression path duration

- Fixation times of region does not correspond one-to-one to processing time of that word due to: 329
  - *preview effect*: when readers have preview of *n*+1 fixation on it is reduced by 30--50 ms.
  - *spillover effect*: processing time of *n* continues during fixation of *n*+1

  > But it is generally the case that how long readers look at a word is a fairly good reflection of the processing time associated with that word. 

- Mixed results on effects of implausible words (pragmatic anomalies): 331
  - Three studies report inflated first fixation duration or gaze duration
  - Rayner et al. (2004) concludes that first fixation effect is related only to lexical identification and not to higher-level sentence integration.

- In reading syntax is parsed incrementally: 332

  > It is clear from several decades of psycholinguistic research that as a sentence is read, the reader constructs an analysis of the sentence's syntactic structure in a highly incremental manner, usually on word-by-word basis.

  - Large body of work (70 studies listed in Clifton et el. 2007) have shown that syntactically ambiguous words do not receive longer reading times. Readers do not process several syntactic options in parallel, or if they do, it does not effect reading time.

    - Example "Since Jay always jogs *a mile and a half* seems like a very short distance to him."

  - Brain-scan does show slower reading times, but:
    - sentences are presented in segmented manner
    - words are presented very slowly, not similar to natural reading

- "Garden-path" sentences prides tool to asses readers default processing av syntactic ambiguities. 333

- Syntactic anomalies (few studies) yield conflicting results: 335
  - Perlmutter (1999) - number disagreement on English verbs on late measures are effect on the verb itself
  - Deutsch and Bentin (2001) - gender disagreement in Hebrew verbs gave first pass effect on verb itself.
