# Owens, J., 2005. The Grammatical Tradition and Arabic Language Teaching: A View from Here. In A. Elgibali, ed. Investigating Arabic. Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Leiden; Boston: Brill, pp. 103–16.

The tradition went from descriptivism in Sībawayh and al-Farrāʾ to prescriptivism with the development of pedagogical grammars.

- Sīband and al-Farrāʾ describes variation (e.g. *-tši/-ki* 3fs enclitic pronoun) and offers explanations to the alternative forms: "explicatory descriptivism". 104-105 From this follows prescriptivism. 109

- 9th century - explicit move towards simplification of grammatical description. Variation in linguistic material is pushed aside. 106

- 10th century. Meta-theoretical speculation. Linguistic sciences becomes theoretical discipline of its own. 107

- "the development of the language sciences in the Arabic-Islamic tradition is perhaps the most remarkable example of corpus planning in the history of linguistic." 108 

- Tradition goes from dealing with oral "living, variable, oral language" in Sībawayh and al-Farrāʾ to dealing with written language in later tradition. 108

- "The grammatical norm becomes identified with an ideal end, but looking backwards, towards a lost ideal." 109

- "Weil's conception of the Basran and Kufan linguistic schools as resulting from later grammarians' efforts to put order into the diverse [descriptive] practices of earlier grammarians is essentially correct." 109

- The development of grammar after the theoretical maturity in the 10th century shows "the power of entrenched professional and bureaucratic interests". Not "academic and pedagogical needs." 110

- Deviant theoretical voices: 111
    - *hāḏā l-rajul* not noun + adjective
    - SV not containing *ḍamīr mustatir*

- Two risks with limited data: 112
    1. inhibition of alternative analysis.
    2. grammatical rules are reified

- Variation in early Arabic larger than later tradition would imply. 112

- Students should be aware that Arabic is partly the product of the grammatical tradition since it has formed Arabic. 115
