# Ryding, Karin, 1991. Proficiency Despite Diglossia: A New Approach For Arabic. The Modern Language Journal 75(2):212-18

Describes teaching in Formal Spoken Arabic (FSA/ESA) at Foreign Service Institute (State Department).

- Had "great success" with this method. 213

- Taught in parallel with MSA. 213

- FSA stable core surrounded by fuzzyness. "For pedagogical purposes, the fuzziness had to be ironed out, and arbitrary, context-based decisions had to be made about feature specification.": 214
    1. SA phonology. 215
    2. SA internal vowels. 215
    3. Use IV verb if there is a IV masdar. 215
    4. "nonhuman agreement is essentially feminine singular" 216
    5. No case endings . 216 

- [Perhaps best described as a way of ESA-fying MSA?]
