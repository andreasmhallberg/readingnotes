# Abu-Rabia, S., 2001. The role of vowels in reading Semitic scripts: Data from Arabic and Hebrew. Reading and Writing, 14(1-2), s.39–59.

- Experiments:
  - word naming in lists of voweled/unvoweled Arabic words.
  - Reading accuracy in voweled/unvoweled text. Two scores per participant: counting/not-counting *iʿrāb* mistakes. Mean score take. 48
  - Reading comprehension in silent reading in voweled/unvoweled  texts.

- [Contradictory statements about within/between participant methods. 47]

- Not producing case/mood vowel is (experimentally) considered a mistake[!]: 48

  > Although not pronouncing the vowel of the last letter sometimes may not change the meaning of the word, to disregard these vowels on ends of words is still considered a reading mistake.

- Unvowlized word naming more difficult. 49

- Negligible difference in reading comprehension in between voweling conditions. 49 [Results of this are presented differently form the word naming experiment. p-value presented for Arabic and Hebrew data together.]

- No correlation between reading accuracy and silent reading comprehension. 50
  - [This can be explained by *iʿrāb* highly affecting accuracy scores but not comprehension.] 
  - Author's explanation: 53

  > The lack of a match is due to the possibility that reading in the silent reading comprehension process with unvowelized tests the reader's cognitive effort is focused on morphological aspects of words: the *triliteral/quadriliteral-root* model of words for lexical access."
