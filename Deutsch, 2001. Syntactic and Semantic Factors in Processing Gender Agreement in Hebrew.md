# Deutsch, Avital, and Shlomo Bentin. 2001. “Syntactic and Semantic Factors in Processing Gender Agreement in Hebrew: Evidence from ERPs and Eye Movements.” Journal of Memory and Language 45 (2):200–224.

- Hypothesis: differentiate between syntactic anomaly in gender and sex. 203

    > violation of gender agreement for animate nouns involves, in addition to the grammatical violation, a semantic mismatch between the biological sex denoted by the subject and the in congruent predicate.  

- Processes associated with single word and its immediate context show in first pass measures (refs to Rayner). 204 

- Effects of subject-predicate discongruence disappears when separated by five words. 204  

- 2 by 2: gender/animacy. 204

- Stimulus
    - predicate always adjacent to subject. 207
    - 104 sentences. Two blocks with pause between.
    - different randomization order for each participant.
    - 25% followed by comprehension question. 208
    - each trial start with fixation point where sentence start will appear. Verifies calibration.

- results
    - gaze duration and second pass duration longer for incongruent predicates. 209 
        - form (morphological) markedness condition showed in first pass
        - unmarked in second pass
    - bigger difference in animate subjects.
