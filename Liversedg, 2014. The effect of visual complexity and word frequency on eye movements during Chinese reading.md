# Liversedge, Simon P., Chuanli Zang, Manman Zhang, Xuejun Bai, Guoli Yan, and Denis Drieghe. 2014. “The Effect of Visual Complexity and Word Frequency on Eye Movements during Chinese Reading.” Visual Cognition 22 (3–4): 441–457.

Testing effect of visual complexity and word frequency independent on word length.

- Complexity defined as number of strokes. 444

- 80 participants [!]. 446

- Results 451
  - Skipping: frequency and complexity have effects. No interaction
  - Reading times (first, single, gaze): only interaction, no independent effects.
    - [Are these three measures meaningful for Chinese were most words are of the same length, ie., one character?]
 
- Effect on fixation, but not skipping, is accounted for by SWIFT and E-Z models. 452-
  - Visual complexity should be accounted for in the models.
