- Semitic writing has always had word boundaries, as opposed to Greek. 43

- Arabic words are constructed by proclitic-prefix-stem-suffix-enclitic. 45

- Diacritics 49
  1. Primary diacritics: dots to differentiate letters
  2. Secondary: vowels, *shadda*, etc.

  - Primary written with full width of stroke and are visually connected to the letter. Secondary diacritics written with edge of tip "which signals them as secondary, or visual 'background' signs". 50

- Final forms of letters imprecise the unity of the word.
