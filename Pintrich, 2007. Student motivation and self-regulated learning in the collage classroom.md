- There is no direct path from personal characteristics and classroom contextual factors to learning outcomes. It is mediated through motivation and self-regulation. Pedagogy affects motoivatio/self-regulation which affects outcomes. 60

- Students need to be engaged cognitively, not only behaviorally (doing what is required without reflecting about content, etc.). 61

- Self-regulating activities conceptually organized by four phases of regulation, with detailed discussions on each cell: 65-87
  1. goal-setting
  2. monitoring
  3. control and reagulation
  4. self-reflection

  and domains

  1. cognition
  2. motivation/affect
  3. behaviour
  4. context

- Perception of task value affects self-regulation: 99

  > Higher levels of task value are associated with adaptive cognitive outcomes, such as higher levels of self-regulatory strategy use as well as higher levels of achievement.
