# Rayner, Keith, and Sara C. Sereno. “Regressive Eye Movements and Sentence Parsing: On the Use of Regression-Contingent Analyses.” Memory & Cognition 22, no. 3 (1994): 281–85.

Argues against *regression-contingent analysis*, presented in Altmann et al. (1990), in which analysis is done separately for trails containing and not containing regressions, and the implicit assumption it is based on that garden pathing always results in regressions.

- Test the assumption that garden pathing always results in regression by re-examining data: 282

  > If regressions are a necesary consequence of garden pathing, then ,when a regression-contingent analysis (in which trials with regressions are eliminated from the data set) is performed [...] the garden path effect should be eliminated or considerably wakened

- Results:
  - When trials containing regressions were filtered out there was an effect of garden pahging on first pass reading times.

- "garden path effects can be demonstrated *both* by an increase in regressions and by longer reading times in the absence of regression." 284
