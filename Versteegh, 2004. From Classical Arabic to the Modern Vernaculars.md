# Versteegh, C.H.M., 2004. From Classical Arabic to the Modern Vernaculars. In G. Booij et al., eds. Morphology: An International Handbook on Inflection and Word-Formation. Berlin, New York: de Gruyter, pp. 1740–1754.

[Good overview of the history and forms of variation in Arabic vernaculars. Several useful tables comparing features.]

- Majority view amongst Arabists that Classical Arabic was supratribal variety/poetic koine. Tribal vernaculars had no icraab. 1741 

- Arabic view that there was only one language in Arab peninsula. Recorded variation (*luġāt*) only in lexicon and phonology. 1741

- 'Language islands' - areas where Arabic is used but that do not use Classical Arabic (Malta, Cyprus, Anatolia, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan). 1741

- Geographical division of dialects (isologloss in 1s/pl imperfect): 1741
  - Western:
    1. Ḥassāniyya dialect of Mayretania
    2. Moroccan
    3. Algerian
    4. Tunisian
    5. Libyan
  - Eastern (four groups):
    1. Egyptian (incl. Sudanese and Chad)
    2. Syrio-Lebanese
    3. Mesopotamian
    4. Peninsula

- "Most scholars would agree" that dialects represent *reduction* and greater *analyticity* compared to Classical Arabic. 1742

- Morphology of the verb 
  - List of common features in dialectal sound verbs: 1742-43
    - Western *ni-* in singular imperfect, *ni- -u* in pl. 
    - Two vowel patterns: *faʿal* and *fiʿil*, in Moroccan only *fʿel*
  - Example paradigm of conservative dialect with many classical features, Ġāmid in Saudi Arabia. 1744
  - Weak verb
    - Iy/w has become strong: *yawlid*
    - IIIy and IIIw have merged
    - Double roots have merged with IIIy
  - Stemforms: 1745-46
    - II and III preserved, only II productive (intensive, denominative, causative)
    - VII, V, or VI used for passives.
  - "The most radical departure from the structure of Classical Arabic is the marking of verbal **aspect**" Durative markers *ʿam-/ka-* etc. 1746
  - Participle used for regulative or perfective aspects. 1747
  - Indirect object as clitic with *-l-*. Eg.: *bi-yiwarri-ho-lhom* 'he shows him to them'
  - *mā ... š* for negative. Eg.: *ma-bi-tigib-hā-lhom-š* 'you are not bringing her to them’

- Morphology of the noun 1748
  - Genitive exponent
    - Long list of variants.
    - Differntiation between 
      - *alienable* possession with exponoent: Eg. *il-laḥm tibāʿi* 'my piece of meat'
      - *inalienable* possesoin with idafa: *laḥmi* 'my flesh'
    - Sociolinguistic variation in use of idafa/exponent
    - Language islands only exponent except for frozen expressions
  - Indefinites:
    - Indefinite article: Ir: *fat*, Mar: *waḍ*
    - Some Bedouin dialects have nunation as connector after indefinite. 1748
  - Number: 1749
    - No dual in verb and pronoun. 1749
    - In language islands sound pl. generalized: Uz.: *zujīn* 
    - Fewer forms of broken plurals in dialects.
    - New plural for professions: *-a/-iyya*: Sy.: *šōfēr/šōfēriyya*
    - Foreign loans with broken plurals: Al.: *bordīl/brādel*. Most loans pl. with *-āt* or *-iyye* 1750
  - Masdar types reduced. Some language islands only one form, Uz.: *(qatal)-ān*

- Demonstratives 1751
  - Wide variation, table.
  - near/far

- Interrogatives

- Pidginization and creolization 1752
  - One documented case: Nubi Arabic. 
    - Origin in military camps, Upper Egypt, 19th century, Arabic speaking officers and Nubian speaking recruits. Recruits settled in Uganda and Kenya. Children creolized language. Ca. 80 000 speakers. 
    - Shows classical features of creol languages:
      - breakdown of inflectional system of original language
      - adjectives have no inflection
      - compound nouns
      - new article from demonstrative (*dé*)
      - verb has only one form
