# Albirini, Abdulkafi, and Elabbas Benmamoun. “Aspects of Second-Language Transfer in the Oral Production of Egyptian and Palestinian Heritage Speakers.” International Journal of Bilingualism 18, no. 3 (2014): 244–73.

Investigates transfer from English in number inflection, genitive constructions, and relative clauses. [General problem that authors have no way of destinguishing between interference from English and incomplete acquisition.]

- Overgeneralization of sound plural forms and anlytical dual (*tnein Saff*) interpreted as interference from English. 247

  [Could just as well be arrested linguistic development. Same thing seen with Arabic speaking children. Authors refer to Omar (2007) stating that Arabic children use incorrect broken plural patterns, but fail to refer to Omar as also stating that they overgeneralize sfp. and make analytical duals, which speaks against their interpretation]

- Material [Same data collection as in several other papers by authors.] 253
  - Participants --  Native/heritage Palestinians, Native/heritage Egyptians, 10 from each group (tot. 40)
  - Task
    - frog story
    - retell Alladin
    - free talk about self
  - Participants

- Results
  - Number
    - Heritage speakers overgeneralize sound f.pl. [Recycled results] 255
    - Use of singular forms for plural. 256

- Heritage speakers have inaccuracies in the use of relative pronouns and receptive pronouns. 266

- Acknowledges unclear difference between transfer and incomplete acquisition: 266

  > Although transfer effects seem to play a role in some areas and in very specific ways, sometimes their presence cannot be separated from other factors such as incomplete language acquisition or attrition.
  
  - and later: 269

  > We think that transfer effects are largely a consequence and a manifestation of the incomplete acquisition and attrition of HLs.
