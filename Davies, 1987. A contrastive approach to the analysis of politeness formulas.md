- Important for learners. 76
  - Not to be rude

    > The better the learner in other respects, the greater will be the danger that their failure to use the appropriate strategies may be perceived, not as evidence of a lack of proficiency, but rather as a sign of disrespect, hostility, or other negative attitudes. 

  - appear more fluent than he or she actually is
  - risk in assuming that formulas are parallel in use and meaning to those in L1. Rarely are. 77

- Teachers need meta-linguistic awareness. Being a native or proficient speaker is not enough teach formulas. 77

- Remarks on a culture or nationality (polite, generous, distant) often due to misinterpretation of politeness formulas. 77

  > a feature which is perceived to be courteous [for example] by speakers of one language may not be so judged by speakers of another.

- Analytical distinctions
  - between semantic content and illocutionary force
    - some politeness formulas have no illocutionary force in and of themselves but are always part of a larger utterance, e.g. *please* 78  
  - socio-pragmatic rules, where, when and by whom the formula can be used.
    - e.g. *good evening* only at night, first meeting that day, formal relation 79
    - Lists Maroccan and English formulas with overlapping bud different socio-pragamatic rules

- Difficult to distinguish linguistic rules from social behavior. 82

  > The question of to what extent learners of a language should also learn to adopt the socio-cultural conventions of its speakers is a delicate one.

- *mabrūk* ≠ *congratulations*. The former used also used without achievement, e.g. on annual holidays. 83

- Formulas may be restricted in use by 84
  - speaker
  - addressee
  - medium (speech/writing)
  - setting

- *lla yxellik*/*lla yrḍaʿlik* both to make request, the latter only to children. 84

- *msekxir*/*msaku*. Latter only by women. 
- *smehli*/*qṭaʿtih men ffummek bleʿsl* (when interrupting). Latter only by women. 

- British [and Swedes] say thanks for smallest favor, like passing the salt. Arabs don't. 85
