# Uhlmann, A.J., 2012. Arabs and Arabic Grammar Instruction in Israeli Universities: Alterity, Alienation and Dislocation. Middle East Critique, 21(1), s.101â€“116.

- Participant observation. 101

- Arab student in Israel consistently struggle with university level Arabic courses. 101

- Arab schools follow traditional Arabic grammar. Discontinuation at university level that Jewish students do not experience. Jews study according to the Westernized model of the university. Must then teach by traditional method as teachers. No use of university schooling. 107--8

- icraab  Arab grammar focus on ``seeks to incalculate not only the facts of grammar, but also a formulaic, stylized, declematory method of analysis.'' Focus on surface forms of grammar, not underlying prinicples. 103 Icraab has several meanings: 114
    - inflectoin
    - ``the act of inflection'', i.e. adding vowels
    - formulaic analysis

- Stakes higher in Arabic language insruction:
    - foreign languages higher valued on the labour markerd. Seen as threat. Gives moral dimension. 103

- icraab ``has come in the Arab tradition to symbolize grammatical mastery on the whole and consequently is emphasized greatly in grammar instructions.'' 104

- ``alianation of Arabs from Arabic grammar'' 105

- Jews learning Arabic get well paid jobs in security sector. Arabs studying Arabic become poorly paid teachers. 105

- Proponents of pedagogical reform of Arabic instruction are hampered by suspision. 109

- Incommnesurability of the two systems of grammatical description:
    - Arab categorization of verbs as augmented by one, two or three letters; Western categorization in stemforms. 111
    - Western method rely on systems of paradigms explaining isolated grammatica pheno/it is menon; Arabic method on pronciples explaining similar phenomenon over a range of categories. 112-113

- Incommnesurability of hidden in misleading translations of terms. 114

- Western model: interesting or boring; Arabic model: love or hate. 114

- ``traumatic nature of Arabic grammar instruction'' 114

- Questions whether the two systems are even comparable, given differences in aims. 115
