# Albirini, Abdulkafi. 2019. ”Why Standard Arabic Is Not a Second Language for Native Speakers of Arabic”. Al-ʿArabiyya: Journal of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic 52: 49–71.

[Povides no definition of second language, and implies different difinitions in different parts of the article to suit the argument. Argument seems to be: if one second language is better the other, then it is not a second langauge.]

- All participants "learned SA formally in public schools" [!]. 54

- Method
  - Oral and written proficiency task in SA, CA, and EN
  - [Topics for language production tasks were not balances, i.e., all participants did oral task on same topic, and writtien task on same topic.] 55
  - Rated for 55
    - fluency (wpm)
    - grammatically accuracy (error-free T-units)
      - incorrect *-tuna* as example of error in spoken SA
    - Syntactic complexity (proportion of multi-clause T-units)

- Discussion
  - SA not L2 because children are exposed to it in childhood [!]: 64

    > even from ana acquisition point of view, one may not conser SA as an L2, because most Arabic-speaking children are usually exposed to the two varieties at an earhly age. [...] Their exposure to SA, event though it may not ve as rich as thier exposure to CA, allows them to develop some level of proficiency in SA.

  - Significant difference between SA and CA in individuals tasks, but [statistical cherry picking]: 65

    > When the ora l and written proficiency scores were combined, the findings reviealed not significant differences bweteen nateive Arabic speakers proficiency in SA and CA.

    - Proficiency in SA is closer to CA than English, and therefore not a L2. 66

Presents results from an experiment showing that native speakers of Arabic have better proficiency in Standard Arabic than in English. [This, together with the fact of early exposure, is taken as evidence that SA is not a second language.]
