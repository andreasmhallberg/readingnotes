# Gully, Adrian. 1997. “Arabic Linguistic Issues and Controversies of the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries.” Journal of Semitic Studies 42 (1):75–120.

[Mostly detailed retellings of specific debates.]

- *Nahḍa* as the "neo-classical" era. 75

- Linguistic issues promoted in newly established Egyptian and Lebanese journals. 76

- Most of the debate conducted by Christian Arabs. 77

- The popularity of the *maqaama* started to wane. Its imitative style met with criticism. 78

- View of language nationalistic; Explicit equation of "the state of the Arabic language with the success of the Arab nation." 79

- Prescriptive works, attempts to "purify" language similar to classical *laḥn* literature. 79

- Two main debates: 82
  1. status of Classical Arabic in relating to dialects.
  2. Purification of literal and press-language

- Arguments defending Classical Arabic always the same (ref to Diem 1974): 87
  1. rich heritage
  2. carrier of Islam
  3. unites the Arabs

- Description of colonial representatives promoting dialect. 87-95

- Efforts to purify language lacked systematic approach. Lists of incorrect and correct usage, mixing lexical, morphological and syntactic preserved faults. 102

- For modern purists nationalism more important than religion: 103-4

  > For the medieval scholar, the question of correct linguistic usage was fundamental for the interpretation of the religious texts. For linguists of the neo-classical [*Nahda*] period, however, theological considerations had been replaced by a widespread belief in the inextricable relation between a stable language and the identity, success and stability of the nation.
