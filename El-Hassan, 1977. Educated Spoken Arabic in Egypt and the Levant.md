- Critique of Ferguson: functional distinction between H and L does not hold. Eg. sermons with L admixtures. 114 [In the example given there are fairly discrete breaks between H and L.]

- Critique of Kay. [Similar to Parkinson (1990).] 116-

- Critique of Blanc (1960): conclusion (numbers, no *iʿrāb*, etc.) not confirmed by Leeds data. [Leed data however very diverse. Difficult to see how conclusion can be drawn from examples.]

- Description of Leeds-corpus. [Only criteria seems to be that speakers be educated.] 120 

- [Many of the examples are MSA with various degrees of case marking, 122, 123, 124. Why are these ESA and not caseless MSA?]
