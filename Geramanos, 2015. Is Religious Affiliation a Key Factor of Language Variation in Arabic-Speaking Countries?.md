# Germanos, M.-A. & Miller, C., 2015. Is Religious Affiliation a Key Factor of Language Variation in Arabic-Speaking Countries? Language & Communication, 42, pp.86â€“98.

Thorough review of research on religious/sectarian language variation.

- Various degrees of differences between Muslim and Jewish Arabic in all North African cities. 87

- In Middle East more complex. In some cites marked differences, in others none. 

    - Eg. in Salt in Jordan variation is by ethnic (Palestinian/Jordanian) variables, not sectarian (Christian/Muslim). 90
    - Between Christians and Muslims in Egypt and between Muslims and Jews in Yemen only lexical differences in terms of address and religious expressions.

- Variation often intertwined with other variables (age/ethnicity/class). 91

- Tendency in research to deify sectarian viarieties ("Cristian Arabic of Baghdad"). Reflecting sensibilities of the author. Systematic comparison with surrounding forms of Arabic often lacking. 91 

- Linguists tend to look for religious-based variation only in regions where religion is ideologically important. 91

- Sectarian variation maintained by:

    1. Sectarian segregation.
    2. Lack of local prestige variety (power wielded by non-local group). 

- Contemporary processes:

    1. Convergence of minority into socially or demographically dominant group. 93
    2. Language death. Group adopting new language: French by Jews in North Africa, Hebrew by Arabic speaking Jews in Jerusalem. 94
    3. Maintenance - Only of very distinct forms of Arabic. 

- Lexicon most distinguishing features of religious groups: 95
    - religious lexicon
    - terms of politeness
    - terms of address
    
- Differences in attitudes towards MSA - Muslims more influenced by MSA. 95

- Conclusion: 96
    - "a diverse situation"
    - Difficult to untangle religion from other social variables

        > Religious affiliation alone is not and has not been a key factor of major linguistic differentiation in the MENA area, it is always linked with other social factors. Nevertheless, even tiny sociolinguistic variation (including salutations and terms of address) will often be enough to identify a speaker as Muslim, Jew or Christian in the same way that he will also be identified as urban or rural, as coming from such and such region, as belonging to popular or middle-class etc.
        
    - "if some features are considered to be shibboleth of a given religious/sectarian community, they are almost always subject to variation"
