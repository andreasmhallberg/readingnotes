# Hudson, Alan. 2002. “Outline of a Theory of Diglossia.” International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1–48.

Overviews of theoretical difficulties of diglossia as a concept.

- In diglossa H and L are *seen* as the same language. 10

- Three types of origins for diglossia: 21 (Jfr Snow)
  1. H has historically never been used as vernacular
  2. H was used as vernacular by some group at some time
  3. H is used by group in other speech community.

- Writing causes linguistic variation: 24
  1. Norms where important matters are written - strive to be "elivated"
  2. Different modes of production (real time, processing, etc)
  3. Literacy acquired by the elite, mark of distinction, signals membership.
  4. Fixates linguistic structures.

- Conclusion: diglossia is: 40
  1. functional compartmentalization
  2. lack of opportunity to acquire H natively
  3. H has no native speakers
  4. stability in use of L for vernacular (but not in H for higher functions)

- Diglossia is a useful concept: 43

  > the similarities that exist between the sociolinguistic situations described by Ferguson are sufficiently different from other types of sociolinguistic situation to warrant their recognition as a category distinct from these other types, such as standard-with-dialects and societal bilingualism.
