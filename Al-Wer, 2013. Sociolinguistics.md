- Labovian method of reading (passage/wordlist) not suitable for Arabic. For example 100% /q/ in reading task. 246

- Higher education does not mean more standard speech 248

  > the empirical results show that longer exposure to and better knowledge of the standard do not result in convergence toward standard features.

- If local low-prestige share features with SA these are dropped in convergence with urban prestigious features. 248

- Must consider differences between dialects in analysis of formal language. Is often not done. Interaction between specific dialect and SA. 252 

- Serious misconceptions brought about by a interpreting all variation through "diglossia":
  - dimensions of variations are uniform. Variation in one Arabic speaking community are transferable to others. 251
  - standard features have high prestige
  - linguistic change is toward Standard Arabic
  - data from Arabic contradict general sociolinguistic patters (women use less standard forms)
