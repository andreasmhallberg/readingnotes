# Kindt, Kristian Takvam, Jacob Høigilt, and Tewodros Aragie Kebede. 2016. “Writing Change: Diglossia and Popular Writing Practices in Egypt.” Arabica 63 (3–4): 324–76. https://doi.org/10.1163/15700585-12341405.

- Survey of *fuṣḥā* and *ʿāmmiyya* writing practices in Cairo.

- Diglossia in Egypt is "in flux" in that *ʿāmmiyya* is increasingly accepted in writing. 326

- Survey of 2529 households. 330

- Results:

  - *ʿāmmiyya* is reported as most commonly used form of writing.   331
    - Dominates social media, instant messaging, and e-mail.
    - Work related e-mail mostily in *fuṣḥā*.
    - Expectancy of use of standard variety to be inflated in self reports of use, yet rates of *fuṣḥā* usage is low. 332

  - Majority agree that *ʿāmmiyya* has a place in written language. 30% disagree. 333
    - Majority find *fuṣḥā* to be most suitable variety in novels, poetry, and news papers. 

  - Vast majority report *fuṣḥā* to be important for Egypt and form them personally. [May be the answer felt to be morally correct.]

  - Some formally correct *fuṣḥā* sentences classified as *ʿāmmiyya*. 338
    - Few respondents categorize any sentence as mixed. 

  - Attitudes:
    - No correlation between positive attitudes towards *ʿāmmiyya* and reported writing in *ʿāmmiyya*. 339
    - Strong correlation between writing *fuṣḥā* and negative attitudes toward *ʿāmmiyya*.
    - People who write in *ʿāmmiyya* are typically of upper intermediate education, young, urban. 340
    - Correlation between writing in English and writing in *ʿāmmiyya*. 

- Unclear whether in reporting use of *ʿāmmiyya* people are refereeing to a simple form of *fuṣḥā*. 343

- Increased use of *ʿāmmiyya* does not necessarily mean that *fuṣḥā* is being displaced. Social media and other informal writing has created new domains of writing where *ʿāmmiyya* is used, without *fuṣḥā* begin used less. 344

- Old guard that is ideologically invested in *fuṣḥā*. 345
