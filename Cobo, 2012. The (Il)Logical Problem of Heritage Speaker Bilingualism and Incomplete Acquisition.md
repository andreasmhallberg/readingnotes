# Cabo, Diego Pascual Y., and Jason Rothman. 2012. ‘The (Il)Logical Problem of Heritage Speaker Bilingualism and Incomplete Acquisition’. Applied Linguistics 33 (4): 450–55. doi:10.1093/applin/ams037.

- Calling heritage speakers' grammars incomplete (as in Montrul 2008) assumes that bilinguals can be streightforwardly compared with monolinguals. Differences in the monilingual and bilingual brain main be reason for differences. 451

- Heritage speakers' input has been affected by attrition, thus constructed grammars must be different from that of L1 speakers' gramamrs.

- Even if input is the same for HS and L1 speakers, it cannot be said that HS shows "incomplete acquisition" 453--4
    - feature may have been acquired and then lost thought attrition. Must make distinction between arrested development and attrition.
    - Differences heritage speakers show may be natural development of conflicting input (of two languages)
