- Graphical features shared by modern writing systems
  - *linear:* characters are differentiated by the line, not by shadings, thicknesses, background, color (Evans 1894). 11
  - Differentiate by orientation is rare (e.g. db).
  - Visual redundancy: (crossbar in \<A\>).
  - Stylistic consistency (e.g. absence of round shapes, fit in square)

- Writing systems emphasize the level of the lexeme: 12
  - *lexical consistency:* one word always spelled the same way
  - *lexical differentiation:* homophones spelled differently
  - *lexical demarcation:* boundaries of word is marked. Most writing systems have at least one:
    - Spaces
    - Colon (Amharic)
    - Bar above word (Hindi)
    - Letters joining (Arabic)
 
- Rare to have more than doubling of element [troll but no trolll].

- Spellings rules derived from phonotactics often perceived as spelling rules. Writing systems may have separate graphotactic rules independent of phonotactics.

- Rarely different characters for allophones. Not noticed by speakers. Reduces number of symbols. 15

- Some elements of speech are typically not represented in writing systems: 16
  - intonation
  - tone (lexical pitch)
    - difficult to isolate
    - changes in different positions
    - difficult to identify in the articulately apparatus
  - Lexical stress
  - Contrasting phoneme length

- Conservatism: 17
  - Speakers are conservative and tolerant of inconsistencies in their writing system. 15
  - Revered documents of the past.
  - (Foreign) Spelling of loan words often retained.
  - Different grammar in written and spoken language. 18

- [Characterization of different writing systems based on above principles.] 18-
  - Chinese
  - Japanese
  - Korean
  - Charokee

- Differences in outer form of scripts: 21
  - Reading direction. LTR dominates.
  - Pictograph's elements rare. Found in ancient scripts. Becomes stylized and looses pictographic element. 22
  - Graphical complexity. Measured in number of strokes.

- Implication for learning to read:
  - In most cultures, children start to learn to read at age of six, when they have good mastery of the language. 23
    - More difficult if written language differs from vernacular.
  - Underrepresentation means that a large part of reading is excluding non-existental words (e.g. <give>, /gaiv/). [Very difficult for adult L2 learner.]
  - Learning to read is an "optional accessory that must be painstakingly boltered on" (Pinker 1997).
  - The ease at which adults read is misleading for the difficulties in learning to read.

- Theories of reading must be informed by knowledge in writing systems: 24

  > If our knowledge about writing is too narrow, perhaps limited to our own writing system and others like it, our theories may be too narrow.
