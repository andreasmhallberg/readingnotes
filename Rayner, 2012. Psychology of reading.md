- Reading is a highly complex skill an breakthroughs in research will only come in sub-components of the reading skill. 7

- Anatomy of the eye. 9
  - Retina is composed of
    - *rods* - distinguish detail and hue.
    - *cones* - distinguish movements, brightness.
  - Fovea consists almost entirely of cones and gives most acute vision..

- *feature detection theory* best in accounting for identifications of letters and text. 11

- Word perception
  - Summary of current knowledge: 50
    1. Skilled readers identify a word in about 250 ms.
    2. Not only converting letters -> sound -> meaning, but sounds play a role. Converting to sound helps short term memory.
    3. Not processed serially letter by letter. Longer words processed as letter chunks.
    4. Larger similar in isolation and in text. A bit quicker in text.
  - Word identification tasks:
    - Naming: skilled readers take 400-500 ms. which is clearly much slower than actual identification. (Not identical to lexical identification.) 52
    - Semantic categorization: 700 ms.
    - Lexical decision (real or non-word) 500 ms. 52
    - Neural transmission from eye to brain takes 80-100 ms. 53
    - Proficient reader reads at about 300 words/min., i.e. 200 ms/word. 53
    - Letter identification:
      - Letters coded as abstract from. Possible to read mixed case quite well. 63
      - Liters identified more accurately in words than in isolation.  
    - Model of fuzzy identification of letter string through parallel feature detection. Letter detectors are excited till they reach a threshold of matching a word. 63-7
      - Words with more neighbors (other words that differ in one letter, controlled for frequency) are more easily identified. 68
    - Consonants more important than vowels for word identification. 71
    - The role of phonological computation:
      - Consensus that sound plays some role. No consensus in how big a role or how to conceptualize it. 72
      - Two routes for accessing phonological shape of word: *address phonology* ("looked up" in lexicon) and *assembled phonology* (contracted from written word) 72
      - Majority view that  both routes are employed (duel route). Quickest one for a given word is used. Model. 79
      - Characteristics of orthography (writing system) in different language may alter the relative importance of either route. 85

- Eye movements in reading
  - Basic characteristics of eye movements in reading. 93-100
  - Perceptual span is fixated word plus two words to the right. Holds across writing systems. 109
  - word skipping 114
  - parafoveal benefit is primarily from the first two or three letters. 121

- Word identification in reading (continuous text)
  - Gaze duration as measure of lexical access: 136

    > we are not claiming that any single measure that one can extract from the eye movement data can be viewed as "the time to acces the lexicon" or the "time to access the meaing of a word [due to spillover effects. But] spillover effects are fairly monor and in amanu cases it isn't unreasonable to think of gaze duration as a pretty good approximation of initial word encoding time" 

  - Eye movement data shows central role of phonological coding in reading, e.g. with preview benefit of phonetically similar but orthographically different word in n+1. 137
  - Word is visually identified after 60 ms., rest is processing time. 145
  - Little is understood about how letter position is encoded. Transposition effect. 149
  - Morphemic decomposition part of normal word identification, not only as a fall-back strategy. 150
  - E-Z reader model. 163-183
    - System may need only bee "good enough" to get most words right. 164
    - Saccade programming is initiated when there is a reasonably good (but not finished) identification of the fixated word. This saves time. 169
    - Average saccade length is 7-8 characters. Saccades regress to this values so that they undershoot longer saccades and undershoot shorter saccades. Similar to other motor movements. 171

- Inner speech (in silent reading)
  - *subvocalization* (activation of articular motor system) vs. *phonological coding* (hearing inner voice)
  - subvocalization: 190
    - increases with more difficult text
    - decreases with increased reading skill
  - Deaf readers lower reading skill
    - Have no access to phonology encoded in alphabet
    - Adults aware reading skill of fourth grader 204
    - 25% of deaf adults are functionally literate
    - Read in language other than their mother-tongue (sign language) 205
  - Phonological coding facilitates reading through: 211
    - storing words in short term memory (which is better at handling audial than visual information)
    - Provides prosody information that helps to parse sentence.
