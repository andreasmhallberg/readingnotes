# Baalbaki, Ramzi. 1994. “Teaching Arabic at University Level: Problems of Grammatical Tradition.” Proceedings of the Colloquium on Arabic Linguistics, Bucharest, August 29 ê Sept. 2.

Teaching Arabic at the university level in the Arab world is burdened by problems of tradition grammatical description.

- Emphases on explanations of grammar, rather than only description of grammatical phenomenon, leading to questionable lines of reasoning, and teaching/students relying in recitation of formulae rather then explaining structures. 86-

  - Problem in all levels of education:

  > From the level of the elementary school up to the most specialized university courses, the teahing of grammar hardly departs from what we know from Sībawayhi's *Kitāb*.

  - Especially with regards to *iʿrāb*

  > students [and teachers?] treat grammar, and especially *i‘rāb*, as standard formulas which they readily produce but hardly comprehend since they were trained mainly to consider the formal aspects of structure with very little concern for the different meanings which different structures express.

  - Examples of problematic *taʿlīl*: 87
    - how some words are explained to be *mabnī*
    - germination of *n* in dual relative pronouns [?]
    - explanation of why the nominative is used for subjects. *ṯiqal*, etc.

- Problems with only have three parts of speech (*ism, fiʿl, ḥarf*): 89
  - resort to expressions like *ism fiʿl* for poorly fitting cases.
  - many words arbitrarily classified
  - practically impossible to find definitions for parts of speech.

- Discussions of meanings of structures, e.g., in variations in word order, taken over by *balāġa*. 90-

- Over reliance on consonantal script for grammatical analysis. Examples: 93-
  - *maqṣūr* nouns. *Iʿrāb* vowel is *muqaddar* on final *alif maqṣūra*
  - *ḥaḏf ḥarf al-ʿilla*
  - [...]

- *Naḥw* completely non-comparative. Many problems in traditional accounts can be solved by comparative Semitic studies. 95-

- Grammatical description as unquestionable fact with high symbolic value: 98

  > The sacredness with which some view the tradition, and the linguistic tradition in particular, precludes any criticism an presupposes that any attempt at change is inspired by enmity and targets the whole culture.
