- 'Formality' has been used in very different ways in the literature. For uses of formality:

  1. "Increased code structuring": more rules than in normal conversation to structure communication. 192

  2. "Code consistency": social rules are more consequent. Eg. T/V not changing. No ironic use of change of code. 193

  3. "Invoking positional identities": "Formal occasions invoke positional and public, rather than personal, identities." Public identities are part of formal structures and are more likely to have names (titles). Private identities build on personal history and do not have names. 194

  4. "Emergence of a central situational focus" - common focus of conversation that encompasses everyone present. Participation must be relevant to focus. 195

  - These fore have patterns interdependence but do not always coincide. 203
