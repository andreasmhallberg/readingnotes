Pedagogical grammars form 8th and 9th centuries use term *ḥurūf ar-rafʿ* for list of word that govern the nominative, in contradiction to canonical theory, according to which nominative in beginning of a clause is governed by *ibtidāʾ*.

- Difference to canonical theory made explicitly in some grammars.

- Disappears by 10th century with standardization of theory. 160
