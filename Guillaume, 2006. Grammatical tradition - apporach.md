# Guillaume, Jean-Patrick. 2006. “Grammatical Tradition: Approach.” In Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, edited by C. H. M. Versteegh, 2:175–82. Leiden: Brill.

- Whole tradition consistent in approach, aims, and methods. 175

- Due to challenges from Greek philosophy
  - came to define itself as independent science (not a helping science)
  - Specify the nature of its eject of study


## Object of styd

- Grammars most often refer to their object of study *kalām al-ʿarab* 176
  - specifically:

> the linguistic usage of the original inhabitants of the Arab peninsula, as opposed to the new, reputedly 'degraded' variety of Arabic that had evolved in the conquered procinces 

- language of these users was innate and infallible
- considered to be corrupt after middle the 8th/2d century (750)
- In practice come to mean closed corpus of texts
  - Quran
  - Poetry from before 750 [first generation of Muslims]
  - Old sayings (to a lesser extent) 
- High degree of variability with data that was difficult to fit in grammar
  - *šāḏḏ*: could not be used to generalize rules, yet had to be accounted for by positing underlying forms/rules
- "strong since" that everything said in *kalām al-ʿarab* was totally harmonious and made since some how

## Aims

- Claims (sins Abu l-Aswas ad-Duʾalī) that aims is to prevent linguistic errors, especially in recitation of the Quran
  - yet early grammars clearly not intended for teaching
  - Though some pedagogic grammar from early on
- Main aim to document and describe 'linguistic heritage' of Arabia
  - reveal hidden wisdom (*ḥikma*) that is unique to Arabic

## Grammatical explanation

- Categories with prototypical properties (*aṣl*)
  - Deviation from prototypical properties had to be explained: occupying marginal position in category, likeness to other category.
- Grammatical categories seen to be hierarchical 
  - Used as principle to organize grammatical treatises, avfter as-Sarrāj's model.

- Major limitation of the tradition is the limitation to study *kalām al-ʿarab*
  - references to other languages "practically nonexistent" in the entire tradition
  - unable to take into account changes in the language
