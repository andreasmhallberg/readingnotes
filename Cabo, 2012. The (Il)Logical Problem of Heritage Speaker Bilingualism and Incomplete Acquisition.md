# Cabo, Diego Pascual Y., and Jason Rothman. 2012. “The (Il)Logical Problem of Heritage Speaker Bilingualism and Incomplete Acquisition.” Applied Linguistics 33 (4):450–55.

- Describing different language competence with heritage speakers as "incomplete" is misleading 451

  > the term incomplete can only make sense under the assumption that comparing HS bilinguals to monolinguials is an inherently justifiable comparison.

- HS speakers always have different input than monolingual speakers due to attrition/language contact in parent generation's speech. Necessarily gives difference in competence. 451     

- Impossible without longitudinal data to say if difference is due to attrition or interrupted development. 453 

- That HS have better competence than L2 speakers may be because they have more training in cognitive processes needed for bilingualism. 454
