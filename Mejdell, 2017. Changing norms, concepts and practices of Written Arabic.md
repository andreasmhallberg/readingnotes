# Mejdell, Gunvor. “Changing Norms, Concepts and Practices of Written Arabic.” In The Politics of Written Language in the Arab World, edited by Jacob Høigilt and Gunvor Mejdell, 41–67. Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004346178.

- Describes Arabic as going through cyclical phases of standardization and de-standardization. 68
  - first codification of *ʿarabiyya* [standardization]
  - non-normative writing in Middle Arabic [de-standardization]
  - *nahḍa* [standardization]
  - current practices in digital age [de-standardization]

- *restandardization* during *nahḍa* came with acknowledgment of the existence of dialects and dichotomous view of diglossia with "clear cut functional distributions". 80

- Current process of destandardization will not be reversed. [?] 85
