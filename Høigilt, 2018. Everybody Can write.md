# Høigilt, Jacob. 2017. “Everybody Can Write! Languag Variety and Voice in Egyptian Youth Magazines.” In Philologists in the World: A Festschrift in Honour of Gunvor Mejdell, edited by Nora S. Eggen and Rana Issa, 193–215. Oslo: Novus.

- Two Egyptian magazines with both Standard and dialect texts: *Iḥnā* and *Kalimatnā*.

- Utilizes both dialect and Standard Arabic but "there is no explicit challenge to the dominant standard language ideology". Standard used to signal authority. 200

- Switches occur between articles or at paragraph level. Little intracentential mixing. No attempt to create new style. 203 
  - not Rosenbaum's *fuṣḥāmiiyy*
  - Not Mejdell's *lugha wusṭa*

- "Revernce for *fuṣḥā* [...] is still widespread, also among people who write a lot in *ʿāmiyya*." 208

- Prioritize "authentic commutation over linguistic orthodoxy." 209.

- Not representing a pro-dialect ideology. 212
