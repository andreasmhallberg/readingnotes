- Non-existance of Standard English: 87

    > many commentators point out that Standard English, as it is usually defined, is not spoken at all but is a particular register of written language; and a number of authors note that Standard English does not, properly speaking, exist but rather is a prescriptive ideal.

- Super-standard English: 88

    > This spoken Standard English, as a primarily in- formal or colloquial variety, differs from formal written Standard English (Carter 1999; Cheshire 1999) but is still granted ideological authority as 'the standard'. Thus spoken Standard English is positioned in relation not only to nonstandard English but also to what I call superstandard English. A linguistic superstandard is a variety that surpasses the prescriptive norm established by the standard.

    > Superstandard English contrasts linguistically with Standard English in its greater use of "supercorrecf' linguistic variables: lexical formality, care- fully articulated phonological forms, and prescriptively standard grammar. It may also go beyond traditional norms of prescriptive correctness, to the point of occasionally over-applying prescriptive rules and producing hy- percorrect forms.

- Ignore phenomena threatening language ideology: 89

    > Erasure, the third semiotic process employed in language ideologies, involves not reproduction but reduction; sociolinguistic phenomena that clash with, fail to conform to, or otherwise threaten a given language ideology may be systematically ignored or denied, stricken from the ideological record.
