# Younes, Munther. 2007. “On ”I‘rāb“, Power, And Language Reform in the Arab World.” Al-’Arabiyya 40/41: 221–41.

- Two views of historical development of icraab
  1. *Traditional:* Present in everyday speech in early Islamic era, then corrupted after exapnsion.
  2. Not present in everyday speech 
     a. Invented by grammarians
     b. Only in poetic koiné

- Icraab probably not used in everyday language by Bedouins.
  - Sibawayhi seems not to have fist-hand experience with Beduin speaking with icraab. All second hand accounts. 226
  - Unclear in the sources whether any information ever from everyday speech or only from poetry. 227 

- Grammarians came up with rules to account for dialectal variation in *qirāʾāt* that is unrelated to icraab: 232-
  1. *mā ḥijāziyya*
  1. *accusative of praise*
  1. *accusative of condemnation*
  1. most importantly *taqdīr*. Assumed verb or other element inserted to explain deviation in case marking. 233

  > Interpolation [*taqdīr*] turned a presumably scientific enterprise into a faith-baised institution, wherby everything could be "explained" by a hidden force to which only the grammarians had access and which the public had to accept without question.

- Grammarians gained power over language (after battle with *qurrāʾ*). Icraab became of ideological importance. 234-
  - Culminated with integration of correct language and law.

- Icraab-ideology today: 235

  > [the student] is constantly bombarded with it and made to believ that it is the key to the mastery of the language. His or her failure to master the system is considered a reflectoin of defective intelligence or lack of effort, and not due to the complexity and arbitraryness of the *I‘rāb* rules.

- Reform of icraab blocked by
  1. Artificial nature of the system
     - System is not based on any spoken language, which constitutes "absence of proof that the system is learnable by ordinary people." 236
     - Does not go through normal processes of linguistic change and simplification since it is not used in ordinary communication.
  2. Association with Quran
  3. Vested interest of guardians of language
     - Social prestige rests on mastering icraab system.

- Proposes "vernacularizaion" of elementary education, as based on Maamouri (1998).
