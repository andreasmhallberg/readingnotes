## Chapter 4: learning to read

- Difficulties with phonological encoding (direct route): 85-
  1. abstract (system of sounds without meaning)
  3. Some sounds (plosive *p, k, t*) unpronounsable by themselves. Children must separate letter names form the sound they designate.
  3. Irregular spellings.

- Four phases of reading: 85-99
  1. *The sight vocabulary-phase*
     - Recognize as small set of words.
     - May start as early as the age if two (Fowler 1962). 87
  2. *Net discrimination phase*
     - Chooses between known set of words that most closely match.
     - *lies, pjoel, likes* all read as *black* (kontains k); *television* read as *children* because it is a ling word; *smaller* read as *yellow* "becaue it has two sticks" (Saymour and Elder 1985)
  3. *Phonological recoding phase*. 92-
     - With growing vocabulary, phase 2 becomes increasingly cumbersome.
     - Direct route suppressed in this phase.
  4. *Orthographic phase*
     - Direct rout becomes increasingly dominant.
     - Skilled reading relies almost exclusively on direct route.
