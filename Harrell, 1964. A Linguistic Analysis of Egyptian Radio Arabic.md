- Studies news broadcast: read speech. 55-77

- Long discussion on phonology. No major difference between CA and ERA. The latter some extra phonemes, particularly in borrowings. 20

- *Nisba* looses CA *šadda* in pause. In speech considered correct and kept. 34

- Pausal form /ā/ for accusative gone in ERA. 34

- Small differences between pause and context forms (i.e case) in ERA and CA. 37
  -But: "What was mechanical variation [paus/context] in Classical has become partially a stylistic variation in ERA." 37

- Operationalization of pause. 38

> A word followed by a perceptible silence is said to be in pause. Likewise a word separated from a following word by one of the junctures /,/, /./, or /?/ [...] is on pause, regardless of whether or not these junctures are accompanied by an interval of silence.  

  - Problems with definition noted by author. 39

- 103 of 593 context positions in pausal form. 40

- Patterns of case marking:
  1. First part of idafa tends to be marked. 42
  2. Proper names unmarked. 43
  3. Article preserves case. 43
     - (*ra’iisu al-gumhuriyya/ra’iis Mubarak*)
  4. Borrowings no case. 44
  5. Numerals: 1-10 CA, >10 dialect. 49
