    > These [*iʿrāb*] endings were looked upon in medieval and modern times as the most precious endowment of the language. The early use of *iʿrāb* is obscure. Nevertheless, in literary tradition traditions *iʿrāb* virtually was an article of linguistic dogma. Since then it has been considered a hallmark of linguistic dexterity and a necessary requisite of clear speech. *Iʿrāb*, except on formal occasions, is ignored in the spoken language and has never been fully mastered by the intelligentsia, let alone the masses. 50

- "The Ummayad court considered good speech a mark of nobility, and insisted on correct Arabic at the court and in other high places." 61

- "There is nearly unanimous agreement that permanent vowels ought to be incorporated as an integral part of the [written] language [...] But paradoxically nothing has been done." 160
