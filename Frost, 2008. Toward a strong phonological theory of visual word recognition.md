# Frost, Ram. 1998. “Toward a Strong Phonological Theory of Visual Word Recognition: True Issues and False Trails.” Psychological Bulletin 123 (1):71–99.

Argues against prevailing dual-acces theory (parallel visual and phonological access to lexicon in reading) for phonological decoding as default. 

- Word recognition as primarily linguistic (and therefore phonological) rather than visual.
  - Reading skills highly correlated with other linguistic abilities. 72
  - Theory of reading should be consistent with linguistic theory, i.e. phonologically constrained words. 73 

    > the same basic structures and processes that characterize human general linguistic functions are involved in processing printed words.

- Phonology is not sound, but abstract representation of sound. Need not be articulated. Absence of articulation in experiment does not mean absence of phonological computation. 73 

- Writing systems are always connected to phonological form in order to be as productive as the language they represent: 74

  > Thus, although writing systems are admittedly not phonographic to the same extent, they all contain at least some cues concerning the phonological structure of the printed words. The main implication of this characteristic is that writing systems were not designed (and in fact could not have been designed) to transcribe units of meaning directly without some reference to their phonological form. This is because languages are productive by nature, new words are constantly being invented, and meanings evolve with time. The only orthographic system that can in principle deal with language productivity is a spelling system that transcribes subword linguistic units, thereby specifying a priori a set of rules for representing novel words.

- Orthography is built on speech and therefore phonological in nature: 74  

  > Being a secondary system, it [orthography] is appended parasitically into an already existing system. Because orthography represents the spoken language, it maps systematically onto phonology rather than meaning.

- Various experimental paradigms indicate automatic phonological computation of orthography:

  - *the backward masking paradigm:* target word is presented for 15-30 ms and is then overwritten with a phonitically or orhtographically similar or control pseudoword for 15-60 ms. Perceived as one event by participants. Phonetically similar pseudowords help identification of target word. 77  
  - *stroop paradigm:* color name printed in other color. Phonetically similar nonwords (*grean* printed in green color) help identify color. 77  
  - *speech detection paradigm* 78
  - *letter-search task:* After brief exposure to orthographic form (*brane*), participants indicate the word contain a letter *i*. 78

    > results from these paradigms consistently tend to suggest that phonological representations are computed following the presentation of printed words, as a rule not as the exception, even in tasks that do not require an explicit phonological output or where phonological recoding hinders performance.

- Consistent evidence form lexical decision task (indicate weather word or non word) that reading in shallow orthographies involves prelexical phonological computation. Mixed results for deep orthographies. 80  

- Lexical phonological code is not detailed. Can be identified with lacking input, only sufficiently specified to identify word. 81 More phonologically specified in shallow orthographies. 82

- *assembled phonology* computed form orthography vs. *addressed phonology* phonological form retrieved as a whole from lexicon after word has been identified. 86 Dual-access holds that both happen in parallel but that addressed phonology is faster and therefore more important in reading.
   - Counter evidence: Japanese words that are usually printed in deep Kanji orthography are more quickly named when printed in shallow kana orthography. 87

- In strong phonological theory of reading skill in reading depends on: 91
  1. speed of assembly process
  2. size of computed orthographic units
  3. efficiency of accessing lexicon with impoverished phonological information.

- Profoundly deaf readers. 92
  - consistently lag behind in reading development
  - evidence of phonological representation, better recollection of rhyming words than non-rhyming and of words with similar signs in sign language. Have access to and prefers phonological representation of words.
