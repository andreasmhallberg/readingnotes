Investigates eye movements in syntactically and pragmatically anomalous sentences.
 
- Small garden-path sentences may be common in ordinary text but readers recover quickly and are unconscious of them. 516

- Methodology problem with anomalies in stimuli in that subjects may come to "distrust the experimental stimuli, so normal processing routines may not be tapped." 524

- 24 subjects.

- Stimuli
  - Triad of stimuli sentences, identical except for verb which makes them syntactically anomalous, pragmatically anomalous, or normal. 525

    > It seems that the cats won't usually eating/bake/eat the food we put on the porch.

  - Examples:

    > a. It seems that the cats won't usually *eating* the food we put on the porch.
    > b. It seems that the cats won't usually *bake* the food we put on the porch.
    > c. It seems that the cats won't usually *eat* the food we put on the porch.

  - 30 target sentences and 76 fillers, some of which anomalous, at least one filler between target sentences. 256
  - Comprehension questions following 20 randomly selected sentences.
  - Practice session prior to experiment, after which subject could ask questions. 257

- Analysis
  - regions (AOIs)
    1. beginning of sentence (0--3 words)
    2. subject
    3. modal verb + adverb
    4. critical verb plus next word, regardless of category
    5. next two words regardless of category
    6. remainder of sentence (0--4 words)

- Results
  - No effect of type of anomaly on time measures (first pass)
  - Regression increased 14% and 20% on regions 4 and 5 in syntactically anomalous sentences compared to baseline (significant). 530
  - Regression increased 6% and 8% on regions 4 and 5 in pragmatically anomalous sentences compared to baseline (significant). 530
  - Differences between syntactically and pragmatically anomalous sentences significant.
  - "Syntactic anomalies caused an immediate, but short-lived, spate of regressions." 532

- Readers tend keep reading to resolve sentence in pragmatic, but not syntactic anomalies. 533
- Similar results in Perlmutter, Garnsey, and Bock (1995)
