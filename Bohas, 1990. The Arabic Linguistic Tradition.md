## Historical survey

- Impetus for grammatical tradition: 2

  > the shift of Arabic from a mainly oral language, specifi to an ethnically (more or less) homogenous community of 'native' speakers, to a language adapted to a basically written use by an elite of mixed ethnic background, within a richer and more complex cultural framework.

- 3 factors forming ALT: 2-

  1. the study of *qirāʾāt*

   > Most of the figures associated with the early developments of grammar and philology ware mention in connection with the branch of knowledge technically called *qirāʾāt* ('reading' or 'recitations', i.e. of the Quran), the purpose of which is was to sift the many variant readings which were compatible with the ancient Arabic script in which the oldest copies of the holy text were written.

  2. the study of poetry

  3. the decree of ʿAbd al-Maliks to make Arabic the administrative language


- Phonetics and metrics reached final form at end of 2nd/8th century as codified by al-Xalīl. Syntax and morphology reached final form in 4th/10th century. 
  - Ibn Sarrāǧ's (d. 928) *Kitāb al-Uṣūl* the first expression of the final canonical grammar. 4

- Quick growth and sophistication has lead to speculations of extraneous influences (Greek logic, Islamic Law). 4


### [Period of early grammar (9th century)]

- Common misconception that Sībawayhi lay down the basic theory and later grammarians only refined it. Sībawayhi had "a quite different approach." 4

- Primary interest in treatises from 9th century is not to formulate generalizable rules, but to discuss isolated data, especially deviating data.

  - e.g. al-Mubarrad (d.989) has one chapter on the plural av *qaws* (*qisiyy*). 
  - Mixing and juxtaposition of levels of the specific and general

- Quranic commentaries of al-Farrāʾ (d.822) and al-Axfaš al-Awsaṭ (d.835)

- Focus on lexicon and morpho-phonology. 6

- Only Sībawayhi had deep interest in syntax.

- Theoretical assumptions implicit. Only came into focus when fact deviate from principle.

- Baṣran and Kufan schools

  - The two main centers of learning in the empire, overtaken by Bagdad in the middle of the 9th century. 6
  - School (*maḏhab*) used for place of oral transmission of knowledge, which may or may not contain theoretical differences: 7

    > In fact, the divergencies between grammarians of Baṣra and Kūfa in the pre-canonical period were simply a particular aspect of the general situation of grammar, where the implcit and informal character of the theory made for the coexistance of several potntially conflicting solutions or analyses for the same problem.

  - Hypothesis (by Fleisch) that the conflict was constructed by later generations of grammarians "as a kind of historical justification" on the rivalry between al-Mubarrad (Baṣran) and Ṯaʿlab (Kūfan), in which al-Mubarrad was triumphant. 7
  - The Kufa school not representative of one method (*samāʿ*) but of diverging opinions ascribed to them retrospectively. Gives the impression of focus on "usage". 7

### [Period of codification (10th--11th centuries, 900- och 1000-talen)]

- All important grammarians of 10th century disciples (or disciples' disciples) of al-Mubaddar, leading to
  homogenization of theory and feeling of community. 8

- Challenge by *falsafa* (Hellenistic philosophical tradition) with its focus on language independent universals,
  degrading the unique status of Arabic, and by association the grammarians. 8
  - Grammarians respond in two ways: 9
    1. Codify grammar into a coherent system of principles and categories (*uṣūl*)
    2. Subject grammar to higher levels of speculation (*ʿilal*, reasons behind grammatical rules)

- *Uṣūl* system devised by Ibn as-Sarrāj (d.928): 10-11
  - facts divided hierarchically into
    1. parts of speech
    2. case and mood (*iʿraab*)
    3. position of *iʿraab*
  - Explicitly base on principles of 'exhaustive divisions' taken from *falsafa* (logic)
  - Practical benefit in that grammatical topics become indexicalized by logical place in the treaties.

- *ʿIlal* 11-
  - Large literature but little available:
    - *Kitāb al-Iḍāḥ* by az-Zajjājī (d.952) and *Xaṣāʾis* by Ibn Jinnī (d.1002)
    - Basic assumption of these books:
      1. Grammar can not only describe facts but also explain why things are so
      2. This explanation is shows the unique harmony of the Arabic language
  - *Xaṣāʾis*  12-
    - Ornate style of the *adab* literature, seeking to be informative and to give intellectual pleasure.
    - Not seeking to be exhaustive or systematic but to show deeper insight by exploring details.

- *Falsafa* faded as an intellectual tradition but left effects on Islamic sciences, particularity with regards to
  logic. 13-14

### [Elaboration of forms of presentatio, decline 11th--15th century (1000 till 1400-tal)]

- "no radical new developments of grammatical theory." Conserves, consolidates, and accumulates. "No eagerness to
  discover new insights." 14

- Common forms are epitome (*talxīṣ*) and commentary (*šarḥ*). Epitome written with the intention to be commented
  and are illegible without them. 14-15
  - *al-Alfiyya* by Ibn Mālik (d.1274) and *al-Ājurrūmiyya* by Ibn Ājurrūm (d.1323) most commented on. 15

- All possible problems with all solutions worked out, quest became to formalize rules in most precise and succinct
  way. 15

- Works from this period have become classics and that are used today as textbooks in higher education. Ibn Yaʿīš, Ibn Hišām, as-Suyūṭiy. 16

- "One of the characteristics of the theory evolved by the Arabic tradition is its extreme coherence and systematicity." 16

- ALT degenerates to prescriptive recopies detached from theoretical context: 16

  > After him [as-Suyūṭiy (d. 1505)], grammatical theory gradually degenerated to into a set of prescriptive recipes, to which some dry strips of dead theory still adhered. The ninteenth-century *Nahḍa*, in the name of simplification and 'common sense', only kept the recipes, cutting the completely from the theoretical roots. This degenerated version of the tradition is, to this day, the basis for teaching grammars used in most Arabic countries today.

## Facts, rules, and arguments

[See also Guillaume, 2006 EALL]

- Following are 17

  > some basic attitudes common to the whole tradition, even if they are perhaps more self-concious and explicit in the classic periods.

- Data
  - Compromise between Islamic and Arab sentiment: both Koran and speech of Arabs seen as pure Arabic. 18
  - View that Arabs lost their contact with pure language about 750 [the time of Sībawayhi] due to contact with non-Arabs, and could not be taken as good representatives of language. 18 
  - Legitimate data:
    1. Quran
    2. old, tribal poetry (in the form of isolated lines)
    2. well known Bedouin poetry and sayings 
  - Any piece of data from these sources had to be integrated and accounted for. 
  - *Ḥadiṯ* not valid data for grammar writing. [See Owens, Arik.] 18
  - Preference to use constructed examples (Zaynd hit ʿAmr), using corpus data only for more obscure facts. 19
  - Dealing with heterogeneous data while still adhering to the principle that *kalām al-ʿarab* is logical and systematic
    - *ḍarūrat aš-šiʿr* 20
    - Distinction between regular (*muṭṭarid*) and irregular (*šāḏḏ*)
      - Methodological principle that generalizations could only be made from regular. 20
      - learner had do memorize irregular words
      - "grammarians devoted considerable energy" to show that irregularities fitted with underlying principles. 21-22

- *Qiyās*      
  - Way of reasoning by which observations are fitted into system of categories. 23
  - Not deductive because it is not clearly procedural  24

    > being onluy conditions by the ability of the practitioner to identify a new sitution as basically similar to an older one.

- Grammar and reality 26-39

## Sībawayhis *Kitāb*

- Was long read as containing what was to become canonical theory. 31
  - Unavailability of intermediate sources.
  - Focus on language "facts" rather than on theory.

- Current understanding that Sībawayhi differ significantly from later grammarians.

- Sībawayhi wrote before terminology was developed. His use of ordinary language and metaphors read by later grammarians as technical terms. 32

- *al-Kitāb* not clearly structured. Material ordered by readers assumed intuitions. 33

- Difficult to distinguish informal commentary on examples from formal declaration of rules and principles, hence difficult to deduce Sībawayhi's overarching theory. 36

- Hypothesis on Sībawayhi as doing pragmatic analysis: 38
  - Lists of alternative constructions are presented and discussed as to how they relate what speaker intends to say. 40
  - Complex terms of judgments of constructions to related to how well they express the speaker's intention. 41

## Canonical syntax (*naḥw*)


- Grammar (*naḥw* and *ṣarf*) was considered prerequisite for any intellectual pursuit. 49
  - "the social function of grammar" as a gate keeper. *Iʿrāb* most important: 50

   > In so far as syntax was concerned, the most important of these features was incontestably the use of case and mood markers.

- Parts of speech (*ism, fiʿl, ḥarf*): Pedagogically oriented grammars enumerate classes and give examples. Theoretically oriented grammars seek to prove that no other system of classification is the only possible.

- Grammatical theory sought maximum generalizability with few categories (e.g. POS) and therefore had to use 'integrative logic' (*qiyās*) to incorporate data. 51
  - A category has a core of prototypical features. Deviating examples are "likened" (*tašbīh*) to other categories.

- POS: three categories, each with core and two "margins" of likeness to other category.
  - *ism* 52
    - core: *ism al-jins, ism al-ʿayn*
    - related to verb:
      - *maṣdar*
      - *ism fāʾil*
    - related to particle:
      - pronouns (uninflected, no meaning in themselves)
      - semi-prepositions (*ẓurūf*, *amāma*, etc.) 
  - *fiʿl* 53
    - core: verb in past tense
    - related to noun: imperfect verb (because of *iʿrāb* endings)
    - related to particle:
      - uninflected *biʾsa, niʿma*
      - auxiliary verbs (*fiʿl nāqis* because does not signify an event)
  - *ḥarf*: residual category, defined as not *ism* nor *fiʿl*
    - related to verb: *inna* and sisters because governs accusative
    - related to noun: none

### *iʿrāb* 53

- Same terminology for mood and case. 54
- Seen as reflecting meaning (*maʿnā*) of word inserted in sentence.
  - Nominative marks *fāʿil* (subject)
  - Accusative marks *mafʿūl bih* (direct object)
  - Genitive marks *iḍāfa*
  - All other uses secondary and derived from these.

- Only case, not mood, seen as conveying semantic information. "verbal *iʿrāb* was simply 'formal'" 44

- "lack of interest in the semantics of the verbal system, which was never approached in a systematic way" 55

- Term *snād* (predicative relationship) only later in the tradition distinguished form *mubtadaʾ* and *xabar* 56

- *kalam* used when semantics are concerned, *jumla* when formal aspects are concerned. 56 

### Government 57

- Principles (never formally laid down but implicitly accepted): 57-
  1. Any *iʿraab* mark is the result of operation (*ʿamal*) from another word.
  2. The operating word (*ʿāmil*) must precede the word that is operated on (*maʿmūl fīh*)
  3. A word never governs a word of its own category.
  4. Government only operates on one single word, the head of a phrase. Other words in the phrase take its *iʿrāb* marker by being dependent on the head (*tābiʾ*) 

- Government of POS: 59-
  - *ism*
    - By definition always operated on by another word
    - Can never govern (when *maṣdar* governs it is the "verbyness" of the word that governs)
  - *fiʿl*
    - Governor "par excellance"
    - Governs at least nominative noun that follows and accusative for all other nouns.
    - Can be governed by several particles.
  - *ḥarf*
    - typically does not govern
    - can govern nouns and verbs

- *ʿāmil maʿnawī* 'abstract operator' phonetically void governed. Most importantly *ibtisāʾ* 60

- Formulaicity and few categories requires abstract concepts to incorporate non-prototypical structures: 60-
  - *iʿrāb maḥallī*: words that do not inflect and sub-clauses 
  - *taqdīr*: elided words needed to explain governance of *iʿrāb*
    - *[ḍarabtu] zaydan ḍarabtu-hu*
    - *ġulāmu [li-]zaydin* [because noun cannot govern noun]

- Person inflections are pronouns, governed for nominative by the verb. 66
  - 3ms person inflection of is void [only if there is no explicit pronoun]. 66

## Morphology and phonetics (*ṣarf*)

- *maṣdar* taken to be the basic form of verbs. 74 

- Words are derived by a layering process where each step adds phonological unit and semantic contents.

- Patterns annotated with *fʿl* system. 76

- Phonological processes seen as driven by lightness (*xiffa*) and avoidance of structures considered to be heavy. 80

- Phonological processes: 80-
  - substitution (*badal*), e.g. *m* → *n*
  - erasure (*ḥaḏf*), e.g. *yaṣil*
  - mutation (*qalb*), only glides (w, y, alif)
  - transfer (*naql*), e.g. *yaqwul* → *yaqūl*

- Phonetics
  - al-Xalīl ordered lemmas by place of articulation. 94
  - Sībawayhi classified consonants by place and manner of articulation, and some other features.
    - System basically maintained by later tradition.
    - High level of sophistication
  - Ibn Jinna (d.1002) first book dedicated to phonetics. 96 
  - Other disciplines interested in phonetics
    - *tajwīd*
    - Physiologists
      - Ibn Sināʾ (d.1037) *Asbāb ḥudūṯ al-hurūf*. 97-8
        - Detailed description of articulatory organs.
        - Identifies role of larynx and sound as vibrating air.
        - Experiments on how to reproduce human speech sounds artificially.

## Study of texts

- Literary criticism
  - "Almost entirely concerned with the study of poetry" 100
  - al-Jumaḥī (d.846) 101
    - First philological approach
    - Historical and geographical classification of poets
    - Put great importance to authenticity of authorship
    - Established term *naqd*
  - Matured in debate with *šuʿūbiyya* 102
    - Elites of conquered cultures fought to maintain cultural dominance. Attacked value Arabic literature.
    - al-Jāḥoẓ (d.868), *Bayān wa-tabyīn* 103

      > nothing less than an encyclopedia of all contemporary knowledge concerning the evaluation of textes

    - Ibn Qutayba (d.889) *aš-Šiʿr wa-š-šuʿarāʾ* 103
      - "first attempt at a structured analysis of the great ode (*qaṣīda*)"

- Greek rethoric (*xaṭāba*)
  - part of *falsafa* (Greek philosophy) and not the field of literary criticism. 104
  - No attempt to apply to actual texts.

- *Uṣūl al-fiqh*
  - systematic study of semantics
  - relation between meaning and form
  - sophisticated  models of meaning of conditionals, quantifiers, determiners, etc. 110
  - Debate about origin of language, whether convention (*istilāḥ*) or degree (*tawqīf*)
  - Relation between form and meaning considered to be purely conventional. 111
    - Feeling of speaker of the opposition explained by repeated association.
  - Accepted evolution of meanings of words (e.g. words loosing figurative meaning), general usage is to be accepted as proper meaning. 111

- Arabo-Islamic Rhetoric (*balāġa*)
  - Developed largely out of debate with muʿtazila in 9th and 10th centuries. 113
    - Muʿtazilite view that Quran created and text that could be studied like any other.
  - Controversy about exact meaning of inimitability of the Quran (*iʿjāz*). Various interpretations:
    - Arabs were 'diverted' from imitating it
    - Inimitable due to contents.
  - al-Jurjānī (d.1078) final conclusion 116
    - Quran inimitable due to eloquence that can be studied by linguistic analysis. 116
