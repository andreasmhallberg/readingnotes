# Taouka, Miriam, and Max Coltheart. 2004. “The Cognitive Processes Involved in Learning to Read in Arabic.” Reading and Writing 17 (1): 27–57. https://doi.org/10.1023/B:READ.0000013831.91795.ec.

[Transcroptions add hoc and awkward. Factual errors in descrotions of Arabic writing system.]

- Tests applicability of Coltheart's account of learning to read on Arabic: 27-8
  a. *Discrimination-net phase*: child can identify a limited set of words and looks for features to choose between them.
  b. *Phonological recoding phase*: maps letters to sounds.
  c. *Orthographic phase*: recognized entire words "without requiring phonological mediation."

- Hypothesis: 41
  - Adults more hampered by incorrectly connected letters since they don't use phonological recording.
  - Presence of vowels affect reading differently for children and adults since adults don't rely on them.

- Participant:
  - Australian-Lebanese school children
    - 3d, 4th, and 6th graders.
    - Arabic instruction a couple of times a week. 42
  - Australian-Lebanese adult bilinguals.

- [Stimulus handwritten in appendix. Will likely affect reading in some ways.]

- Results:
  - 6th graders score better than 4th graders in reading tasks of real words and non-words. 45
  - Real words with incorrect letter positions (List 5). Same accuracy for children and adults but adults were slower, 105 vs. 174s. Indicates that children use phonological recording where letter connection form is not relevant. 47-8
  - Children much more likely to read undiacritized non-words (List 3) with final *-a*. Linear effect over age. Indicates that skilled readers skip final short vowels. [Only for verbs since the non-words were interpreted as verbs with fianl -a. Can it be generalized to nominals?] 50-1 

  > Typically, in high skilled reading, one observes that fluent readers do not place emphasis on the vowels on the ends of words but tend to ignore and not pronounce them, replacing the with a 'skoon' diacritic [well...].
