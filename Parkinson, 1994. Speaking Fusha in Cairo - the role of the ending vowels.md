[Why study the SA of speakers who never use it and make no claim of knowing it.]

- Ambiguous case vowel in 'elision sites' is ignored unless it is obvious [?] that it is meant to be icraab. 181

- Strong preference with all to produce *a* in perf3m.s. Cannot be incorrect. 183

- Large variation of rate of case marking among the four speakers. Given as average counts per page. 184

- Uneducated speakers use occasional vowels without relation to syntax in order to mark their speech as SA. 185 
  - One speaker: "'if you want to vowel something, use /a/'". 192 

- Possible memorized frozen expression with icraab. 187

- Use of *a* as connecting vowel preceding article to give flavor of *fuṣḥā*. 189

- Words with enclitic pronoun often case vowel. 191

- Indefinite more often marked than construct state in iDaafa. 191, 200

- Numbers not inflected as nouns. 192

- Longer analysis of speaker with prescriptively correct speech.
  - "utterly unique". 207
  - "with a fluency and ease that his nothing short of breathtaking". Annoying to the interviewer. 207
  - "This performance could only com from someone who is somewhat withdrawn from an engaged role in the more dau to day society around him". 209
  - Compliance with pause rules. 201

- Conclusion: 
  - Icraab necessary marker of SA but difficult: 207

  > It is clear that all speakers, when they decide to do *fuṣḥā*, whether for just a part of a sentence or for a whole exchange, use the ending vowels along with other *fuṣḥā* markers to indicate what they are doing. Most use them just occasionally, sprinkling them through their text at a certain rate to give the flavour of *fuṣḥā* without making it so difficult on themselves they would not be able to speak at all.

  - Proficient speakers aim lower than formally correct speech so as not to seem distanced/pedantic. 209

- Characterization of speaker using prescriptively correct endings: 209

> this very performance could only come from someone who is somewhat withdrawn form an engaged role in the more day to day society around him
