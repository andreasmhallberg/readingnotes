- "The types of pauses are characterized by the syntactic and semantic completeness or incompleteness of the preceding phrase" 19

- Consensus on four types of pause: 28
  1. *waqf tāmm/lāzim*: 'semantic and syntactic independence', obligatory pause, lest meaning is changed. 29
  2. *waqf kāfin*: 'syntactic independence but is linked to what follows semantically.' Pause preferred but not obligatory.
  3. *waqf ḥasan*: 'syntactic and semantic independence, yet it might be a complete phrase'
  4. *waqf qabīḥ*: 'total syntactic and semantic dependence'
