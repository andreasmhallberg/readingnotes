[Brief description of hostory and thoery of the Arabic grammatical tradition and Arabic classical lexicography.]

- Two driving impulses:
  1. religious *qirāʾāt* and Kuran. 46
  2. pedagogical/prescriptive. 47

## History

- Historical debates:
  - Did the tradition develop independently or under Greek influence (as present in Syriac educational practices, if not in actual texts)? 48
  - When did it arise? Traditional accounts of origins and Basran and Kufan schools. 48

## Grammatical theory

- Focus on syntactic positions: 51 

> Arabic syntax is by and large an expiration of what can occur and cooccur at each of the thirty or so syntactic positions which are customarily distinguished.

- Largest unit of analysis is sentence (*kalām* or *jumla*), but this is not a structural unit. There is no "agent of the sentence". Parts are explained as dependencies between themselves, not as part of a larger clause structure. 52

- Morphology (*ṣarf*):
  - Root (*aṣl*) and non-root (*zāʾid*) special status. 53
  - Much concerned with mutations of root consonants in different positions and parts of speech.

- Interest in categorizing forms as *aṣl* (unmarked) and *farʿ* (marked). Finding the "ideal" example on every level (morphology/syntax). 54

- Interest in pragmatics led to some investigations in word order (SVO vs. VSO). 55

## Lexicon

- Notably less structured than grammar. Different forms of lemma haphazardly singled out, often without indicating meaning or relation between forms. 55
