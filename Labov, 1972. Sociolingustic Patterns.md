  2. Interview
  3. Reading
  4. Word list
	
- Signs of casual speech: changes in tempo, pitch, breathing. 95

- Test of linguistic insecurity: List of words with socially significant variables. Subjects are asked which is correct and which they use. Difference is a Index of Linguistic Insecurity (ILI). 117

- Problems with the study of intuition. Questions the accessibility and homogeneity of linguistic intuition. 191ff. 
  - Acceptability of syntactic forms changes with different stimuli. 193. 
  - Generativists develop own intuitions. 199.
	
- Speech is well formed: 203

  > the great majority of utterances [in everyday speech]---about 75 percent---are well-formed sentences by any criterion. When editing rules of ellipsis are applied, and certain universal editing rules to take care of stammering and false starts, the proportion of truly ungrammatical and ill-formed sentences falls to less than two percent.

- "'vernacular'---the style in which the minimum attention is given to the monitoring of speech." 208

- Eliciting intuition of non-standard: 214

  > But it is almost impossible to obtain interpretable results on the reverse type of *vernacular correction tests,* in which the subject as asked to correct standard prestige forms to the nonstandard vernacular.

- "In careful speech, women use fewer stigmatized forms than men [...] and they are more sensitive to the prestige pattern." 243

- "*social attitudes towards language are extremely uniform throughout a speech community.*" Suggests this grounds for definition of speech community. 149
