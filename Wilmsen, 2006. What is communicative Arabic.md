# Wilmsen, David. 2006. “What Is Communicative Arabic?” In Handbook for Arabic Language Teaching Professionals in the 21st Century, edited by Kassem M. Wahba, Zeinab A. Taha, and Liz England, 125–38. Mahwah, N.J: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

Argues for focus on vernacular Arabic in Arabic programs and to start with vernacular before Standard Arabic.

- Idea of students talking to intellectuals in cafes: 129

  > A fondly held delusion among university Arabic teachers is that graduates of their programs will spend their time in salons and cafés conversing with the language's higher registers with Arabic intellectuals.

- Educated Spoken Arabic is a "pedagogical red herring." 130

  > To the question 'What is Educated Spoken Arabic?' (*pace* Mitchell, 1986), the answer is, it is vernacular Arabic.

- "Communicative Arabic is largely vernacular Arabic." Students that reach near-native fluency do so by own perseverance. 131

- Advantages of starting with vernacular
  - allows students to "err, as it were, in the direction of the vernacular, as native speakers do." 134
  - students who only complete two years of Arabic can communicate with it.
