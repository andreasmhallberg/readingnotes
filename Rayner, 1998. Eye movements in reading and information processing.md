- 3 eras of reading 327
  1. 1879--1920 - basic facts on eye movements discovered (blind during etc)
  2. Little research on eye movement to infer cognitive processes.
  3. Mid 70's -- technical development, large amounts of data. Testing of linguistic theories.

- General facts on eye movements 373
  - Fixations are 300--400 ms 
  - Saccades velocity 500°/s. Effectively blind during saccades.

- Reading
  - fixations around 225 ms in silent reading
  - saccades round 2°, 8 letters, and take around 30 ms 

- Tree types of small saccades 373--4
  1. *nystagmus* - constant tremor 
  2. *drift* lacking motor control 
  3. *microsaccade* -- correction of drift

  - considered noise in reading research

- Visual field 375
  1. *foveal*: central 2° Best vision. Move eyes to place object in foveal vision.
  2. *parafoveal*: 5°
  3. *peripheral*: beyond parafoveal

  - primary function of saccades is to bring material in fovea.

- can move attention without moving vision, but tightly connected in reading

- Reading English 375
  - fixation about 200--250 m
  - mean saccade size is 7-9 letter spaces.

- Letter spaces appropriate length measure in reading. 375

- skipping 375
  - 2--3 letter words fixated 25% of the time
  - 8+ letter words almost always fixated

- *regressions*: backtracking eye movements 375
  - 10--15% of all saccades. 
  - often a few letters long to correct too long forward saccade 
  - longer saccades due to readers not understanding. Good spacial memory for regression landing.

- First fixation of line 5--7 letters in. About 80% of line between lateral fixations.

- Typographical factors have small effect on eye movement measures. 376 

- Frequent words get shorter fixations. 376

- In reading no correlation between fixation time and saccade length. 376

- Measure of processing time 377
  - Units longer than single word
    - total first pass fixation time.
    - unclear how to best treat regressions
  - Units consisting of single word
    - Problems:
      - that words are sometimes skipped (and processed during fixation of previous word)
      - words are sometimes fixated more than once.
      - processing of word continues after saccade (spillover effect)
    - *First fixation duration*: duration of first fixation regardless of other fixations on word.
    - *Gaze duration*: sum of all fixation prior to saccade to following word.
    - One single measure likely to crude. Common strategy to analyze part of sentence using a number of measures

- Effect of adding saccade duration to processing measures is small. 378

- Perceptual span: 380
  - Investigated using moving window paradigm. 
  - 14-15 letters to the right from fixation
  - 3-4 letters to the left from fixation
  - Opposite fore RTL.
  - Smaller for Japanese (13 letters). Chinese 5 letters. 380
  - Words not identified to the right. Word lengths and beginnings of words retrieved.
    - May be enough to skip word. 381
  - *Word identification span*: smaller than perceptual span. 7--8 letters to right.
  - No semantic information obtained in parafoveal words. 383 

    > The size of the span varies as a function of orthography and is smaller for more densely packed writing systems. 381

- No information obtained from line below. 381

- Word boundaries most important in deciding landing of saccades. 385 
  - Removing inter word spaces slows reading by 30%.
  - Adding spaces facilitates reading also when disallows in orthography
    - Thai, German compound words.

- Where to land in word
  - *Preferred viewing location*: where fixation in word is typically made. Halfway between beginning and middle of word.
  - *Optimal viewing location*: where fixation time is shortest. Closer to center of word.

- Little is known about regression since they are difficult to control experimentally. 387

- Alternatives to eye-tracking. 391
  - *rapid serial vision*: words appear on same physical location on screen. If two quick system gets overloaded. 
  - Self-paced reading - problem that reading speed is halved. Fingers react slower than eyes.

- Reading speed 392
  - Fast readers make shorter fixations, longer saccades, fewer regressions.
  - Poor, beginning and dyslectic readers make longer fixations, shorter saccades and more regressions. 393
  - Bilingual readers like faster readers in dominant language.
  - Children who stutter make more fixations and regressions.
  - Speed reading 393
    - Normal reading around 250 wpm.
    - Speed reading 600-700 wpm
    - Speed readers do as well as normal readers on overall comprehension question but poor on parts of text they had not fixate.
    - When normal readers are asked to skim text their eye movements measures are very similar to those of speed readers.
    - Research on speed reading consistent with idea that speed readers are skimming.

- Results from scene perception and visuals search cannot be generalized to reading. 397
