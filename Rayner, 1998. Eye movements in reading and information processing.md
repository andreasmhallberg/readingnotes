- "When reading English, eye fixation lasts about 200--250 ms and the mean saccade size is 7-9 letter spaces." 375

- Fixations:
    - Many words are skipped, function words very often. Long words almost always fixated. 375
    - Frequent words get shorter fixations. 376
    - No serial letter-by-letter scan. 378

- Perceptual span: 380
    - 14-15 letters to the right from fixation
    - 3-4 letters to the left from fixation
    - Opposite fore RTL.  
    - Smaller for Japanese (6 letters). 380 "The size of the span varies as a function of orthography and is smaller for more densely packed writing systems." 381

- Generally good spatial memory of where text has been misunderstood. 387

- Quick readers identical to skimming of normal readers in movement patterns and retention. 393
