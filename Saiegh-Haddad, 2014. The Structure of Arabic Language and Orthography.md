[Only section on orthography covered here.]

- Dots on letters standardized in 8th century. 15
  - Modern Arabic has "two sets of diacritics" 17

- Orthography reflects Meccan dialect (Quran) later adapted to prestigious Najd (Eastern) dialect. 15-
  - *Hamza*: absent in Meccan
  - *Alif maqṣūra*: as *ay* in Meccan

- Arabic terms for diacritics 17
  - *taškīl* [collectively]
  - *ḥarakāt*, also for graphemes

- *ʿalamāt al-iʿrāb* distinct subset of diacritics 18

- "the bulk of Arabic script is unvocalized" 18

- "partially vocalized script" with only word-internal vowels. Used in texts for native speakers learning to read.

- Six letters that not attach forward called *ḥurūf ar-rafs* 18

- Even very young Arabic speakers are engaged in Standard Arabic on a daily basis: prayer, TV, homework: 20

  > Thus, besides proficiensy in using Spoken Arabic, linguistic proficiency in Arabic involves, from an early age, concurrent proficiency in using Standard Arabic.

- Children's programs dubbed to Standard Arabic. 20

- *al-ʿarabiyy* can be used as umbrella term for all varieties of Arabic, or only for Classical Arabic. 21

- "fully vocalized Arabic may be paradoxically more opaque than unvocalized Arabic" due to addition of case/mood inflection. 25

- Vocalized Arabic is shallow in principle, but psycholinguistically deep, since it does not represent language of child learning to read.
