# Trudgill, P., 1975. Accent, dialect and the school. London: Arnold. 

- Definitions. 17.
  - 'dialect' = grammatically defined variant
  - 'accent' = phonetically/phonologically defined variant.

- Standard English is a dialect. Every dialect can be realized with every accent. 18

- Social pyramid of dialectal variation in Great Britain. 21

- Standard language ideology, real language, moral judgments: 27

  > In fact there is a very widely held---although erroneous--- view that standard English is *the* English language. This inevitably leads to the belief that all other dialects are deviations from the norm, and, often, that these deviations represent 'corruptions' due to ignorance, carelessness, laziness or stupidity.

- View that dialects have no grammar. Their grammar is not in accordance with grammar books. 40

- Two types of mistakes:
  1. Form part of standard variety but there is an idea that it is erroneous (e.g. stranded preposition, "It is me"). Often rules derived from Latin. 42-43 [See Curzan 2015]
  2. Form not part of standard. Dialectal form. Stigmatized. 44

- Pedagogical/educational problems related to standard-dialect variation :63-64
  1. Accent: reading and spelling difficulty, if the teacher is not familiar with the child's accent.
  2. Accent: alienation from school, if attempts are made to change the child’s accent.
  3. Dialect: interference from the native dialect in standard English, if standard English is required or rewarded.
  4. Attitudes: resentment, alienation and linguistic insecurity, if the child’s accen and dialect are belittled.
  5. Attitudes: subconscious evaluation by the teacher of children with higher-status accents and dialects as academically more promising. 

- Possible solutions: 65-70
  1. elimination of non-standard - train away dialect. Not feasible. Alienates students.
  2. bi-dialectism - teach standard as a second (and not only "correct") dialect.
  3. appreciation of dialect differences - societal change where dialects receive equal status.

- Discusses the four proficiencies and how they ought to be related to dialect/standard. 73-81

- Moral judgments: "Many people now regard even a singe 'spelling mistake' as a incontrovertible evidence of abysmal ignorance" 81

- Writing reading skills through dialectal writing. Examples of actual application. 83 [Cf. Maamouri]

- Warns against discourse of 'verbal deprivation': Peter Harriot, Andrew Wilkinson, J. Patrick Creber, F. D. Fowler. 95
