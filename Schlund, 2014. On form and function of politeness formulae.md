The linguistic form of politeness phrases is not arbitrary.

- Theoretical background
  - *normative/traditional approach*
    - "politeness is a set of socially stipulated, culture-specific norms of behaviour". 273
    - held implicitly by grammars
    - unsystematic
  - *pragmatic approach* 274
    - Brown and Levinson's (1978) face theory
  - *post-pragmatic approach* 275
    - politeness is negotiated in sito

- *abstract contexts*: Native speakers can identify certain phrases as polite. Politeness of a phrase may vary with context (tone of voice, irony etc.) but speakers associate them with most common use if devoid of context. 277

- *politeness indicators*: linguistic features that are typical in politeness phrases. Radial (fuzzy) categories. 278
 
- Distance is the basic metaphor. Many theories of politeness actually deal with distance. 

- Cultures often classified as having a negative or positive few of social proximity in politeness system. 280

- Definition of politeness phrase: 281
  1. "have to be formulaic on order to be recognized as PF by interlocutors."
  2. operate in cooperative social situations (as opposed to impoliteness, which is also formulaic).

  - Nominal categories: number, person, diminutive
  - Focus on speaker/addressee.
