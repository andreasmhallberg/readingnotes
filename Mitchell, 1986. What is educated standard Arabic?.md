# Mitchell, T. F., 1986. What is educated standard Arabic?  International Journal of  the Sociology of Language 61, 7-32

[Largely repetition of 1980.]

- Diglossia not discrete strata: "It is the interplay between written Arabic and vernacular Arabic(s) that creates and maintains Educated Spoken Arabic." 8

- ESA is characterized by no stigmatized forms, no high-flown forms. 

- "High-flowns | +F –F | sitigmatized", where the middle constitutes ESA. 
  - Forms classified as one of these four.
  - Classification of same form may be different for different dialectal areas.
  - Utterances may thereafter by classified.

- This is not levels: 12

  > There is one fundamental difference between our view of ESA and those briefly outlined above [Badawis, Blancs och Meiseles nivåer]. We do not see it as one of a series of separate varieties, on pair with MSA and the vernaculars, but rather as a created and maintained by the constant interplay of written and vernacular Arabic.
    
  - [Yet: "although it draws heavily upon both MSA and the vernacular, it nevertheless is its own variety of Arabic." (Mitchell 1985:56, cited in Ryding 1991)] 

- "if they use **ʾi’ʿraab‘**, then by definition they are not speaking ESA. 19 (underline in original)
